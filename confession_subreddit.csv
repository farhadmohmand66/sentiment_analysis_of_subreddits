adultery,"I'm cooked, chat🌬️Ventilation💨 (self.adultery)","I am reeling. It wasn't supposed to be like this! It was supposed to be a way to make my marriage more bearable, just jokes and sex with someone I felt safe with. But chat I'm almost 37 years old and have never felt this way in my entire life. I'm so fucking stupid for him I want to scream. In my wildest dreams I could never have imagined him because I would never have had the fucking audacity. And apparently he feels the same way? Which has my heart skipping, and my brain turning to mush, and any smidgen of common sense that I previosuly possessed rocketing off into the wild beyond. I'm desperate for the denizens of reddit to bring me back down to earth and explain how these awful, terrible feelings are just NRE and adrenaline from sneaking around, or some sort of midlife crisis late-onset manic episode after a long period of numbness, or some other heady mix of neurotransmitters and pheremones that aren't real and can't hurt me. I'm equally desperate for your stories where it was genuine and true and it turns out magic does exist and when you both felt like you were waiting your whole life to meet each other, you were actually right. Preferably stories that haven't ended with your heart wrenched violently from your chest to run around in the world with someone you can't keep? Can there be long fierce secret smoldering love that stays tucked tenderly inside, and the fire keeps you warm on cold lonely nights without ever burning your children's house down? A hidden oasis you steal away to to quench your thirst – always secret and sacred and blooming through all the droughts and deserts of real life? And chat.... did you know? Did you know in the very marrow of your bones that it was real? Were your bones right? Or were your bones foolish naive snake- oil nonsense-salesmen? For reasons I'm sure you're all all too aware of or you wouldn't be here, none of this would ever be able to live in truth and daylight. So I'm left having to figure out how to believe that I'll be able to survive all these fucking feelings and the way my whole body hums and aches for him. Am I fucked??

adultery,Thank you chat🙌✨Good Vibes✨🙌 (self.adultery),"Two years ago I met an amazing women on AM, we hit it off. I was 32 at the time, she was 38. The sex was...damn mind blowing. The challenge was finding time to see her and slowly it kind of faded away, we still chat to this day but nothing more. I then stopped all of this extra mural activity and tried to focus on life with my wife. The urges never left and the marriage/sex life didn't improve but we pushed through. Now im back and searching for a new AP and I just sometimes wonder if there is something wrong with me. I was born with desires others dont, that's until I start reading this thread.

adultery,Why does this hurt so much?😩Donezo🥩 x 🌬️Ventilation💨 (self.adultery),"I never thought I’d be here…writing something like this, grieving someone I was never supposed to care this much. What started as a simple conversation between two people somehow turned into something deeper than either of us expected. Something raw. Real. Consuming. He said he didn’t mean for this to happen. That he started the conversation that led us here. But now he’s carrying the weight of it like it’s crushing him. He told me he hates how he hurt me… even though what he developed was a deep, instinctive need to protect me. That contradiction wrecks me. Because I felt it too—that need to shield each other from the world, even if the world was everything standing in our way. He wrote me a goodbye letter. It was one of the most heartbreaking things I’ve ever read. He said I’d always own a piece of his heart. That no one will ever own him, or his body, the way I did. And yet, we never even touched. We never got that one night. That one goodbye. It’s like being haunted by something that never physically happened but still left permanent marks. It hurts because it was real. Because he saw me. He understood me in ways no one else has. And now he’s gone, and I’m left wondering if I’ll ever feel that again. Wondering how you move on from a connection that felt more alive than anything else in your life. How do you mourn someone who was never really yours, but somehow held your soul? Why does this hurt so much?",Visible_Fault_6070,https://old.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/1lg7zbw/why_does_this_hurt_so_much/
adultery,I miss you so much - after 6 months and after you deleted me letter💌Letter to...Someone📮 (self.adultery),"Dear You, I miss you. I miss you so much. The days after you left felt like pure shit—empty, colorless, and hard to navigate. I’ve tried so many ways to move on, just like you probably have. But no matter how much I try, you still live in my heart. And that pain… it’s real. You might not realize this, but every moment we shared still resonates deeply within me. The laughter, the glances, the rush of being near you. You made me feel alive in a way I hadn’t known before. You made me feel seen. Desired. Loved. Even though it didn’t last, and even though I was the one who let go of a 10 years relationship for something so wild and uncertain, while you couldn’t—or wouldn’t—I don’t regret a thing. What we had was raw and real, even if it was short. I wish letting go didn’t hurt this much. I wish remembering you didn’t feel like a quiet ache I carry with me every day. But I carry it all the same, because that ache is proof that it mattered. I just want you to know this: I’m grateful for you. Truly. I only have good things to say about you—about the way you touched my life and the way you made me feel during those months. No matter where life takes us, I’ll always remember you with warmth. You were a beautiful chapter in my story. And even if you’ve closed that book, I’ll keep the pages I shared with you safe. Take care of yourself.

adultery,Tinder video selfie verification?💻Hello IT?📞 (self.adultery),"So I decided to roll up a Tinder account to see what's out there. Upon the advice I saw here I used my burner phone number and OpSecure email. Put two photos on it; one a silhouette that is dark enough to afford plausible deniability and a ""chin down"" body photo. These seem to be the defacto standard for ""married but looking"". Also as per most advice here, I was immediately up front in the first sentence of my profile detailing that I am married and looking for something discreet. Profile looked good and was remarkably unremarkable... I had access for all of 10 minutes, all of it spent fleshing out some relevant details from the multiple choice lists. Suddenly I was met with a screen telling me I'm locked out pending video selfie verification. How should I proceed here. Also, not sure if this has an impact but I had forgotten I was working through a VPN while I was working on this and so once it was up and running it started presenting profiles from Chicago (I'm in Dallas). I disconnected the proxy when I realized this and corrected my location to something more appropriate to my location. This did not immediately shut me down, so I'm not convinced this was the issue, though VPN IPs do sometimes get flagged by some sites as, predictably, people do some shady shit on these. Anyway, what do you make of this video validating thing and have any of you had to deal with this?",GentlemanDom72,https://old.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/1lg6q6b/tinder_video_selfie_verification/
adultery,"AP is buying a house, mixed emotions🌬️Ventilation💨 (self.adultery)","I have been with my AP for more than 6 years now. Both dead bedrooms. It was supposed to be just for fun no string attached but... we happened to become best friend real life and keep enjoy intimate moments when we can. Our lifes at home aren't bad. Some challenges with kids, a partner who is a good parent and except for the lack of sex and occasional frustrations a fine person to live with. On both sides though we lack that emotional connection with our SO and don't feel like they really value us. I love him. He knows it. I know he cherishes me as well, he shared with me more than he ever had with someone, but he will only say the L word to his kid, as the jaded man he is. We discussed going legit. We know each other pretty good now, the good, the bad and ugly and we know we would really be a good fit and know where it could be problematic and even discussed how we would manage that. We don't even wish we met earlier, at that time we wouldn't have fit together. But now... Now we have kids, we both bring the bread on the table at home and especially on his side, the partner is financially dependent. And the stigma of divorcing. Seeing our kids half the time. All the inconveniences and financial complications. Would it be really worth it? And the doubts. Would it really be better and are we not doomed to the same? Maybe. Maybe in ten years when the nest is empty we could try. Who knows. Let's enjoy what we have now. I would do it. I know you shouldn't do it for another person. But I would. I have really though long and all about it. I told him. I even almost broke up at some point. I was almost at a point of divorce at home, ready to actually end my relationship and to seek real love elsewhere. But I realise I just wanted him and if it was not for him, it was not worth it. He says he is too much of a chicken to do it. He would really love it but he just can't see how to make it possible. I think he really thinks that but I know if he really wanted to he could though. Anyone could. But I know he made it to hell with his partner before and is too proud he stayed then and that it's slowly getting better. He feels like it's his duty to stay as he put it. So here we were last year, I decided that, under some conditions, I was OK continuing our AP relation, as, with those conditions it would bring me more happiness than pain and any choice would be painful anyway. He really made sure the conditions were fulfilled and we have been doing so well, I'm so happy about us. We see each other often as friends, do activities together and with other friends, chat daily, and the sex, when possible is still amazing. And then now... AP has had some financial challenges in the past where he had to step back from home ownership. However he bounced back beautifully and is now able to buy is dream house. I'm so happy for him and praying he actually gets it. I only want to see him happy. And at the same time, this is so difficult for me. I'm not the jealous type and yet I find myself wanting I was the one that could be buying this house with him. I would love to go through to this whole process with him, he is so fun to brainstorm with about. Also, the pain is it's actually bringing us a step further away from being able to do legit as he add extra financial complexity with his partner (while at the same time securing some financial security for himself for the future so it could actually help long term if we ever...). Then I have my own frustrations. I wish my husband would agree on some renovation at our home (that I would pay...!), but nope. And why am I even saying that, we have a beautiful house we bought right at the beginning of this affair anyway. The irony. So here we are. I'm shouting my pain on the internet as, although I shared a little bit of my struggles about that with AP, I don't want to bother him with those misplaced feelings. I wish we could go legit. My husband is not a bad person, I'm not just not in love with him anymore, we grew apart long ago and while we take care of each other, the passion is long gone. This is so painful while I'm at actually the best connection with AP in years. So I'm a bit puzzled. Would it ever be enough? There are so many more things I wish we could do together that we will probably never will be able to do. It makes me so sad. I know I should look at what is possible, because that's a lot. But still. I'm struggling today. Thoughts welcome, does anyone recognise those struggles? How do you deal with those feelings? I feel I could need some help to regulate myself now...

Still, I think of you often and hold close the connection we shared. Over the years, we exchanged countless messages—pieces of ourselves. We shared our lives, our secrets, much mischief, and our silences. Even though we never met in person, there was something rare and real between us, something I still carry. I often wondered what might have been if the timing had been kinder. I craved the thought of meeting you as much as I craved you. If by some twist of fate you ever come across this, know that you left a lasting mark on me. I still think about what we were… and what we could have been.

I don't think I'll get more from him. So what is this to him? It upsets me that, at times, as we're having a cool convo, he'll throw his wife into it, mention her and that totally bums me out. I want to stop talking to him but he asked me so sweetly to not stop calling him throughout the day and he drops everything to talk to me. I don’t believe he would ever step out on his wife.

adultery,Ick🧠Thoughts🤔 (self.adultery),"So I don't really like that expression, but it does encapsulate perfectly how I feel right now. AP is giving me the ick. Lately communication has been bad, and their behaviour very immature. There's an age gap which may account for some of the poor behaviour. But starting to wonder whether AP isn't slightly psychopathic and manipulative. Or maybe it's just the lack of maturity. I think the fact they are having an affair in the first place baffles me. They seem happy in their long-term relationship. In their defence, we didn't seek out an affair, it just happened - but having observed their behaviour and from what they've said, I think they tend to get into strange friendly relationships, acting as a very attentive listener, and making people feel special, which could be a form of manipulation. The love bombing at the start was incessant. Now less so. When we're together they are very sweet and caring, but also turn up late and drunk, choosing to spend hours drinking rather than meet me at an earlier time. I do think they are easily swayed when in the company of friends. Again, could be immaturity. So I don't know what to think anymore. Sure, the sex is fantastic, but I actually feel a bit sick to the stomach, which I think is a sign that I should put an end to it.",Sure_Reporter_5087,https://old.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/1lfktgq/ick/
adultery,Am I the odd one out?🙋‍♀️Question🙋‍♂️ (self.adultery),"Throwaway because I need to vent/ask this question but I don’t wanna hurt anyone’s feelings directly. There are so many women on here complaining that all men are after is sex. Where are these guys at?? Any pAP I speak to gets too emotionally invested way too quickly. I’ve responded to a few ads but (even when I explicitly state I’m not looking for anything super serious/romantic, just a fwb type situation) the guys are just way too clingy, expect good morning/goodnight texts, need me to be constantly telling them what I’m up to, and get all passive aggressive and whiny if I don’t reply for a day or two. My SO is like this, he can’t do a single thing for himself and is always bugging me, it’s like having a child. I need an AP that is not a fucking baby needing my constant attention. My marriage has all these annoying expectations, I thought an affair was supposed to be the fun escape from that? I just want good sex and to have a laugh with a guy every now and then, not be in constant contact and be expected to small talk all day every day about shit that I don’t care about. I need a grown arse man. You are all annoying as shit. I’ve got shit to do, don’t you? I don’t have time to spend all day stroking your ego. Sorry. Rant over. Women of this sub - am I really the odd one out here? Is everyone else seeking this emotional constant connection? Am I just being coldhearted? I just want a good time without feeling like I have another chore on my list, is that so bad? Edit: I don’t mind so much if an emotional connection naturally builds over time. It’s the fact that guys want me to act like their girlfriend after we’ve only been talking for a day.

adultery,A vent🌬️Ventilation💨 (self.adultery),"Heav'n has no Rage, like Love to Hatred turn'd, Nor Hell a Fury, like a Woman scorn'd Did I create this account just so I could vent my spleen? Why, yes. Yes I did. I've been around these parts for a while now, both as a poster, and a responder. Read the posts where guys bemoan that they're only coming across bots, scammers and OF girls. Well, here's what it's been like from a woman's perspective. Amongst the garden variety conversations that fizzle, I offer you these gems of humanity. The guy who claimed to resemble a B list celebrity but photo swap revealed him to be about 5 stone heavier. He whinged about his wife not living up to his ideal, yet it turned out he'd married her and brought her to a new country where she couldn't speak the language. His sexting game only involved him replaying encounters he'd had with said wife. The hot dad bod guy who claimed to want an OA but really only wanted more likes for his pics. The phone sex guy who whose dirty talk was quite good. So good, in fact, that he got himself off before I was close. Not once, but twice. More fool me I suppose. The nice guy turned stalkerish. Started tracking my hours, when my period was due... The kinkster who admitted he was into candaulism. Oh! But he wouldn't do that to me. Just his wife of decades, who he claimed to love. Dude - that is truly disgusting, not to mention illegal. The stoner who wasn't over his last AP. She was so great! The connection he'd had with her was like nothing else! Yet she left him for another AP. Maybe instead of seeking to replicate what you had with her, it might be a good idea to look for someone different? Dom#1 pleaded family illness as the reason for leaving me unread for days on end. You realise your TG shows me the times you were last active? Wasn't me you were talking to all those times. Douche.

adultery,Caught and SO admitted for psychiatric help😬🙃 x 🎣 Caught! (self.adultery),"Not really sure what the point of this post is besides to get some feedback. We’ve been married for 6 years, have a 6 year old child. Dead bedroom for most of that. He’s been very distant and won’t talk about how he’s feeling or what is on his mind, which is the opposite of what it was like when we were dating. I’ve tried to talk to him about getting therapy, or on medication several times over the past few years but the conversation always gets shut down. About eight months ago, flirting with a neighbor turned physical and I’ve been in a Situationship with them ever since. SO found some incriminating photos as well as vibrators which led to him asking questions. I disclosed parts of what was happening, but not that it was a neighbor. During this discussion, he told me that he attempted to kill himself several months ago, and that he feels like he has nothing to live for. I convinced him to go seek help today and now he is being admitted for 3 to 5 days for inpatient psychiatric treatment. I feel guilty that I didn’t notice the signs and that it’s come this far for him. I’m not sure what his mental state will be when he leaves the inpatient facility, but I’m hoping he gets to a place where we can talk and go to therapy for sake of our child.

adultery,I saw this disaster coming and still rode the ride🌬️Ventilation💨 (self.adultery),"I have been married for 2.5 years and have a toddler. My husband and I haven’t had sex since I was in my second trimester. He blames being too busy and has never had an honest conversation about it. It’s not an attraction issue. I am fit and attractive and bounced back relatively fast. I ventured into adultery and had two brief affairs. The first one was alright, but didn’t have the fireworks I was looking for. The second was not even worth speaking about. After those, I told my husband that I wanted to separate. We are currently in the slow process of it, but have some health issues with family members we need to address first. We still get along great and are excellent coparents to our son. We are still living together, but I told him that I no longer wanted to be his wife that I was going to see other people. I haven’t given him any further details because I don’t wanna hurt him, but I am so done. A couple months ago I met a divorced man out in the wild. I have never been more attracted to someone across the room in my entire life. He felt the same way and pursuit me immediately. He was very persistent. We spent a couple hours chatting while our kids played together at a party, and I was very open and honest that I was still married, but in the process of separating. He understood and was fine with it. We dove headfirst into a long distance, Situationship. This man was intelligent, successful, but I could tell very complicated and had a lot of baggage of his nasty divorce. He was pretty upfront with the issues he had, and I accepted them. I was absolutely consumed by him and spent a couple weekends with him after that. We had incredibly deep conversations, and I was on a high the entire time. I noticed he was slowly fading last week and gently confronted him. He immediately got defensive and almost nasty. Completely denying it even though it is very obvious if you read through our texts. He seemed very insecure about me still living with my husband. I think he believes we’re still having sex although I’ve told him time and time again that we are not. We started to reconcile and works through it yesterday and then he completely left me on read. He’s done this before and I’ve had to extend the olive branch, but I just don’t have it in me. I’m so tired of being rejected. From my husband, and now him. I think I fell in love with him and I’m completely brokenhearted over this. I’ve read so many posts on here warning about the dangers of dating single people, but I stupidly didn’t listen. I was hooked from the second I saw him. I am so hurt over this. I haven’t been this devastated since my first boyfriend and I broke up when I was 21. I’m not sure what the point of my post is. Any responses are welcome. I have thick skin. I know I just need to buckle down and work toward my eventual divorce, but I am more brokenhearted over losing this man then my husband and father of my child.",praiseme481,https://old.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/1lfekbj/i_saw_this_disaster_coming_and_still_rode_the_ride/
adultery,Awkward feelings😬🙃😑🙄 (self.adultery),"I’ve been stepping outside of my marriage for a little over 6 years now. I’ve had long term partners and short flings. Yesterday I experienced something different. I was talking to a girl from tinder and we hit it off. I was upfront about my situation and she didn’t mind. She lives 2hrs away from me. Right after lunch she asked if I would go visit her over the weekend. Well let’s just say the conversation and chemistry were so strong I left work early and drove to her town. We went on a date, had some fun and went back to her place for amazing sex. I spent the night and drove back into town just in time for work. The problem is I think I’ve caught feelings for her. My heart just jumps anytime I see her text me. I’m not in a situation where I can leave my wife and I’m not sure why I’m feeling this.

adultery,I married my affair partner🦮Halp🆘 (self.adultery),"I married my affair partner. We had an affair for almost 3 years and I actually married my ex husband during the affair. I am not proud of how I behaved and if I had my time back, I would have done things so much differently. We are married 6 years now and we have two great kids. We are together officially for 12 years, when we both left. We both agree that we made the right decision. He married someone who was totally incompatible and frankly a bit nuts and I was on the wrong path having been in a relationship with my ex since I was 19. I didn’t have the guts to end it and so I lied and cheated instead until I finally left. Even though we have built a home together and have our family and our own separate independent careers, I still feel judged and very uncomfortable in the company of certain individuals who would have socialised with my husband and his ex wife. His ex wife basically made things very difficult for us telling all sorts of lies about me. The eldest daughter is as manipulative and cunning as her mother and had made a pretty good job of doing her mother’s bidding and turning people against me. In particular, I notice that my husband’s nieces and nephews (the daughter’s peers) have a particular disdain for me which they cannot hide. His daughter is quite sweet to my face. My reason for this post is sparked by the fact that I attended a funeral of the parent of one of our friends who would socialised with my husband and ex wife. We have socialised with them regularly and gone on holiday with them for years now. Their daughter who is quite friendly with my husbands eldest daughter not only complexly blatantly ignored my when I said hello to her but threw me a look that would cut me in two. She was quite friendly to me a few years ago but has obviously bought some spin or other that has been put to her. To put this in context, the kid is around 28 years old so I should be able to shrug this off but I literally became so angry internally that I couldn’t sleep these past two nights. I feel very resentful of these people and my mental health is suffering as a result. It also confirmed to me what I have suspected for some time now. That something has been spun and bought about me that has caused a major shift in attitude from people over the past 3-4 years. I guess the funeral episode upset me as it is a culmination of this type of attitude toward me. Everyone is fine with my husband and more than friendly to him. I seem to be the problem. I would love to get to a place where I allow this type of behaviour from people to go over my head. I am not going to confront anyone. I simply wouldn’t have the courage and I am not sure I could convince anyone. I am looking for assistance and advice on how to be more resilient and how not to feel crushed when this stuff happens.",Low_Evidence_2541,https://old.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/1lf6oy9/i_married_my_affair_partner/

adultery,Long term situations?🙋‍♀️Question🙋‍♂️ (self.adultery),"What’s it like having a long term AP/FWB? I’m currently in an open marriage. I used to cheat and had an AP for 6 months. We fell in love and the break up was devastating for me, probably not for him. Eventually opened up my marriage and things are great! I know many on here probably have their brow raised skeptically, but it’s a good feeling. I empathize with those in less desirable situations. But anyway, it just hit me that I’ve been seeing the same guy for 6 months. We’re more fuck buddies than truly enamored with each other, but still leads to reallllly fun and hot sex. I think my question is this: what does a long-term fuck buddy look like? My only other extramarital relationship died out right before the 6 month mark. I can’t imagine I’ll feel anything when I can no longer see my current friend. It’s always felt like it works until it’s no longer convenient for one of us. But it’s just.. an odd feeling to realize it’s still going and feels good for both of us. I wouldn’t even describe us as a situationship these days. Maybe early on I felt a little bit more in the dark at times, but now it just feels like he’s still into me. I’m like, oh? Cool. Curious to hear about those who’ve had long term relationships, maybe more on the fuckbuddy side versus a real loving relationship.",According-Bet-3676,https://old.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/1lesh5a/long_term_situations/
adultery,Are we a “type”?🙋‍♀️And Another Survey Question🙋‍♂️ (self.adultery),Are people who actively seek out affairs a certain type of personality in general? What is it that makes us deliberately look for something more? Is it a flaw in our character or are we actually simply following the human instinct to sow our wild seeds (so to speak)?

adultery,Feeling envious🙋‍♀️Question🙋‍♂️ (self.adultery),"I’m struggling. So before my LDAP and I became a thing, we would text. We have switched to a different messaging platform and for obvi reasons, his notifications are off. So he doesn’t know if/ when I’ve messaged him, and if he’s with her, clearly he isn’t checking all the time. I could be left not read for 12+ hours between evening/ovenight/morning. Is it bad that I am envious that his friends, coworkers, acquaintances can have unfiltered real time access to him by a simple text message because he doesn’t need to hide messaging them? His contact with me has to be deliberate and planned because he can’t talk to me in front of his SO. I make myself feel “less than” because I can’t have the same access. It’s like when I went from friend to AP, i “lost” something…that spontaneous friendship, random memes that i want to send, a quick laugh. I know I’m just venting and this is what we signed up for, but is anyone else envious of the unfiltered “public” time and attention others can get from their AP?

adultery,Layered Emotions😩Donezo🥩 (self.adultery),"New here. How do people process?! I feel deep guilt over the emotional affair I had before asking my long-term partner for separation—not because I regret the connection, but because I always thought I’d never cross that line. I don’t regret the experience itself. It reminded me that I can feel alive, seen, and desired. For a moment, I wasn’t just surviving—I was thriving emotionally, even if it was in a way that wasn’t fair to my partner. I needed that wake-up call, and I needed to feel like me again. It was exactly what I needed to stay strong and stick with asking to separate after 10 years together and young kids… I had already tried to communicate my needs. I asked for therapy, and I tried to make our relationship work for the sake of our family, our history, and our kids. When he refused, I was already emotionally checked out. The affair didn’t cause the end of our relationship—it came out of the end. When the online affair ended suddenly, after MONTHS and a plan to finally meet, it felt like the floor dropped out from under me. I’m not just grieving a relationship with my partner—I’m also grieving the escape, the version of me that felt free. It’s hard to process both things at once. He was caught by his wife and understandably cut things off! There are a ton of unsaid things, I know that things were real for both of us and yet, here I am. It’s been weeks and I can’t stop thinking about him. I’m respecting his boundary but how the hell do people move on when you can’t even tell a friend!?",SeveralPantsLater,https://old.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/1lefa1n/layered_emotions/
adultery,I now understand why I’m feeling numb when there are people who like me😩Donezo From ChatGPT’s Perspective🥩 (self.adultery),"Called it quits with him a week ago and wow, my ex AP really fucked me up so much. I was trying to understand why I feel numb and not getting attracted at anyone at all. I went to my trusty Co Pilot and explained my feelings and I got this explanation. You're not broken. You're processing something deeply painful, and your response—this emotional shutdown—is your brain’s way of protecting you. It makes sense that after heartbreak and betrayal, especially when you've allowed yourself to be vulnerable, you'd feel hesitant to open up again. Feeling numb isn't a flaw—it's your defense mechanism kicking in. Anxious attachment can amplify these feelings because it craves connection while fearing loss. It’s a tug-of-war between wanting closeness and fearing the consequences of opening up. The numbness might be your mind’s way of keeping you safe—like a temporary emotional pause while you sort through what happened. And trust, once broken, doesn’t rebuild overnight. You’re afraid of repeating the past—of being led on, undervalued, hurt again. That fear is valid. But you’re also self-aware, and that’s powerful. Instead of focusing on what’s “wrong” with you, try asking: What do I need to feel safe again? Whether it’s time, boundaries, or deeper self-reflection, giving yourself permission to heal at your own pace is key. I am probably traumatised that I’m just going to get my heart broken and I am very careful now to give my heart to anyone because of the bullshit I experienced with him. They’re not the problem, I am the problem. My heart says take a risk with someone but my brain just keeps getting in the way. They are definitely not the problem, it is me who’s the problem. I should probably heal before I navigate in this world again because I don’t want to be unfair, I guess. I don’t want to be the person who broke me.",CupPsychological8845,https://old.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/1led1i3/i_now_understand_why_im_feeling_numb_when_there/
adultery,Struggling with what next… (45/m)🦮Halp🆘 (self.adultery),"I’m having an existential crisis. I’ve been living through a DB the last decade. No amount of conversation or counseling has change the situation. I had come to terms with the fact that my life would forever lack the passion that I so desperately needed and wanted. I thought I was ok with it all. Until, a co-worker and I connected. It led to more. The more turned into the most intense, connection EA and physical connection I have ever experienced in my life. It’s changed me. Some for the better, some for the worse. My sense is that my AP will end things soon as she’s struggling with containing her emotions and balancing her own family issues. She’s already cut off physical contact and shuts me out regularly when her emotions run high. It’s torture for me. I feel a need to hold onto what we had but also feel emotionally used. I’ve never considered myself a cheater but this experience fundamentally changed me. I feel as if I found a part of me in her. The idea of losing her makes me sad but also gives me hope. Hope that there’s more to life - more to my life. I realize this is a bias group but I’m struggling how to move ahead. Any suggestions I’d I’m open to. Do I pull back and protect myself? Do I help my AP get over me and move on by allowing us to stay friends but keep the emotional connection (this would be torture for me). Do I acknowledge that there’s more to life and find someone new to connect with? Is that even possible? Or is she truly that special? Any and all advice would be appreciated by someone m or f that’s gone thru this.

I’ve even sent follow ups asking if they aren’t interested in chatting or if I said something wrong and nope no response. It’s getting exhausting to be honest.

adultery,Do you know what his angle is?🦮Halp🆘 (self.adultery),"This has been going on since 2014. A past coworker that I barely knew started messaging me on FB. We talked for a while but I didn’t think much of it. He was extremely cute. Now a firefighter. 2 kids, and his wife was gorgeous. He was also 31 at the time and I was 39. (Now I’m 50 and he is 42). (I won’t go into all this issues with my husband he isn’t into me or anyone). After a few times the talks started getting dirty. About 6 months later after talking he came over for 15 minutes and we made out. Just kissed on my bed. That was it. After that he kept texting me for a few months, erotic stuff, saying he wanted to get together again but “had to be good”. Then he went quiet for a year. 2015 he texted me saying he cheated on his wife and was getting divorced and was with the girl he cheated on her with. He then continued to text me saying dirty things again and saying he wanting to hook up with me but it didn’t happen. All talk. 2016 he broke up with his gf and texted me the same stuff. We did meet up again at his house. This time it went further (didn’t have sex though) I was so nervous as he did things my husband would never do. I wasn’t able to be fulfilled and was too inexperienced to know to fake it. He said I was the only girl who he couldn’t get off….I guess he had been with several since his break up . He was single for a while and texting me on and off. Sometimes 3 months would go by and then I would hear from him again with the same old stuff. How he wanted to have sex with me but he had to be good. 2019 he got married again and had more kids. Was still texting me with the same stuff but would ask me if I want to have an ongoing affair and meet up. I knew he was all talk so I just played a long. Of course we didn’t ever meet up until 2022 when he said he just wanted to meet for hugs. We did a few times at my house in a parking lot where we would just hug for 10 minutes. He acted like he didn’t want to let go. 2024 he came over for a hug and we started kissing. Moved to the couch. It was fun. Didn’t do anything more than make out. Since then he has been texting me regularly but again saying he “has to be good” but really wants to have sex with me and me be his side GF. Or asking me to meet and then backing out. Saying he had talked to his church and a shrink about me and his thoughts of “wanting to make love to me”. I don’t really believe him and he is probably saying this to many girls? He insists in the only one he talks to. It’s just such a strange thing though for so many years.",Timewilltell755,https://old.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/1ldsjvc/do_you_know_what_his_angle_is/
adultery,The edge of something👨‍💼Work👩‍💼 (self.adultery),"I've never moved so close to being a an affair. I'm in my mid 40's, she's in her late 20's. I've been talking intimately and so frequently with a work colleague it's became all encompassing. We bond over what we miss in our lives - we're both in relationships, and she's everything my partner isn't. She has children, I don't. She's so warm, beautiful and passionate and on the weekend we sexted for the first time and I kind of freaked out a little - I've talked about intimate stuff before but always kept it at arms length and suddenly it was very close. We talked and I said I need to take a pause, the thoughts of how this would affect my partner wouldn't leave me alone - we might not be in the same space but we do care for each other after years of our relationship. But I can't stop myself being drawn back in. We spoke again today (I finally messaged after days of silence at her request), and we're meeting tomorrow.. I'm not sure I'm built for this, but it's hard to resist. I've not felt like this for so very long, I mean decades. Feel like I'm in my early 20s again. How sustainable is this? It feels if it keeps on everything might fall apart - we both love what we do, her relationship is almost certainly more broken than mine, but she has children and neither of us want to tear our lives apart. It feels like this came out of nowhere and swallowed me up. It feels like it's going to be an ultimatum of sorts this week, even though nothing has happened physically emotionally I'm in knots whenever I think about her.

Her and her husband are basically roommates with kids and don’t share a room. My wife and I have had our issues and “trying to work it out” but trust issues are always there. My AP doesn’t like me bringing up anything having to do with my wife or kids but she does it all the time (brings hers up). Today I had to take my wife to a medical procedure and lied to AP about it. She wouldn’t have wanted detailed but would’ve questioned why I couldn’t see her. I made time to see her for 5 minutes before “I left town” and I’m positive she followed me and drove by my house and saw my vehicle at home. I couldn’t call when she wanted and when I did she called me out on it. Said it was a waste of 4 years and asked for screenshots of my texts with my wife and screenshots of my photo album. I didn’t send. It would tear her apart even more. She didn’t want me to lie but I couldn’t tell the truth. I’m torn, I want to fight but it’s so hard to. We wanted to have a life together. Any “lies” I’ve ever told were if I was doing something with my wife/family. It sucked. I’ve neglected work. It’s like living two lives.

My husband and I have had a difficult relationship with lots of fighting and intensity. Mostly from my side and I know he’s tolerated a lot for me. If we split up, for details I can’t go into too much, it would mean him leaving the country and I feel immense guilt for this.

adultery,Am I being too picky with AP search or is this normal?🔍Search Button🔎 (self.adultery),"Hey folks, Been lurking here since the start of this year, and after a few months of trying to find the “perfect” AP, I’m honestly starting to feel a bit frustrated. Thought I’d post here and get some advice or perspective. My situation is this: I’m (mostly) unhappily married — about 50% of the time. My wife has a lot of insecurities and a bit of a victim mindset, but divorce just isn’t an option right now. We have a kid, and while things aren’t great between us, she’s an amazing mom and I’m a great dad. I don’t want to mess up my kid’s life. Also, we’re expats with different passports, so the whole divorce thing would get extra messy anyway. So for now, I’m where I am — and hoping to find an AP as a bit of personal escape. But here’s where I might be messing myself up: I’ve been VERY picky. I pretty much only want someone in a very similar situation to mine — married, “trapped” like I am, and with just as much to lose. My fear is that if someone doesn’t have that same risk, things could get messy or one-sided real fast. I’ve been posting [M4F] ads regularly on various r4rs, but as a guy, I obviously don’t get flooded with responses. On a good day, maybe 1 or 2 actual chats. But even then: - A lot of the women are based in the US (I’m in Dubai, so not helpful). - Or their situation just doesn’t match what I’m looking for. For example, I’ve turned down: - Women who recently broke up and wanted to “try being with a married man” for the excitement. - Women who were into the age gap thing. - Couples or women in open relationships, where again I feel like they don’t have the same level of risk as I do. And to clarify: when I say “turned down,” I don’t meant they were knocking on my door all ready to start an Adulterous relationship, I mean after a few chats, once I learn more, I politely tell them I don’t think it’s a fit because they’re not married and don’t have as much at stake as I do. So honestly, 50% of the rejections are just because of location (which is fair), and the other 50% are probably me being overly picky and paranoid. So my question is: Am I doing this right? Should I keep waiting for someone who checks all my boxes? Or should I chill a bit, loosen my filters, and see where things go? Would love to hear your thoughts. Thanks in advance.",throwaway_250852,https://old.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/1ld2olh/am_i_being_too_picky_with_ap_search_or_is_this/
adultery,Patience and Luck🙌✨Good Vibes✨🙌 (self.adultery),"From a man’s point of view, we’ve seen enough posts about how difficult it is to find someone who’ll talk to us, let alone connect on a deeper level. I’ve been there myself. We’ve also all read the stories of how men fumble with their AP. I’ve been the one fumbling, too. I spent a lot of time dwelling on my past mistakes and getting frustrated with the whole process of finding someone. I thought I had used up all my luck, and I’d never meet anyone who could match up to my exAP. I was about to give up entirely…... and then I found her. We didn’t start out talking about anything romantic. In fact, our conversations were centered around things completely unrelated to an affair. Our connection started over topics like food, travel, anime, festivals, music... We never ran out of things to talk about, and the vibe was definetly not sexual at first. It just flowed effortlessly. As the days passed, we exchanged pictures, and I was honestly in awe. She’s gorgeous but it’s more than just her looks. There’s something about her that’s just… seductive in a way that goes beyond physical attraction. She’s cute yet hot, assertive yet sweet, and confident yet humble. I couldn’t believe someone like her was here. But if I hadn’t had the patience to wait and if she hadn’t been in a space where she was available to connect, I wouldn’t have found her. I catch myself smiling every time I see that notification from her. I really hope that, in time, she’ll feel the same. Even if it’s not right now, I’m willing to be patient.

adultery,Has anyone else’s affair actually saved them?🙋‍♀️Question🙋‍♂️ (self.adultery),"I had an emotionally abusive childhood which led me into an abusive marriage to a narcissist. I stayed for two decades because I was made to believe it was best for my children but mostly because I had no self worth and I believed I did not deserve to be loved or treated well.

He was kind, caring and supportive, the exact opposite of my spouse. He helped me to realize that I had value as a person, and his unconditional love and support gave me the strength I needed to leave my shitty circumstances. Now, I am one year post divorce and my kids are thriving. My life and health have improved dramatically and I actually have hope for a future. I struggled deeply with the guilt of it all, but now I don’t care. I gave my spouse everything and owe him nothing. My affair saved me. Just wondering if anyone else ever had a similar experience.",JackandAnya_Mom,https://old.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/1ld1onl/has_anyone_elses_affair_actually_saved_them/
adultery,What would you suggest to 30s female with no kid🦮Halp🆘 (self.adultery),"I feel screwed up. I’m 32F, no kids. My marriage is not a dead bedroom. My husband wants love and attention in every possible way. I have comfort, care, and stability with him. I can trust him for life, and if I stay, I know I’ll have long-term security. The problem is we’re deeply incompatible in values and communication. We almost divorced last month, but he apologized and didn’t want to lose me. So now we’re trying again. But I keep wondering, what if I meet someone more naturally compatible? Sexually and emotionally. Someone who doesn’t have to try so hard to make it work. SO is really showing his effort and I feel grateful for that. Also, I’ve had a full-on affair for the past year. We’ve been married for four years. Even though things are improving with my husband, I’m still seeing my AP. I don’t see a future with him. It was a romantic relationship before, but now it’s just for pleasure and feeling worshiped. I don’t find my husband sexually attractive. Sex is okay, but not like with AP. I’m mostly responsive with my husband, but with AP I feel intense desire. My husband can’t have kids. But sometimes I worry, what if something changes and I get pregnant? I want to avoid that at all costs. I feel like a narcissistic coward. Why is it so hard to end things either way?

secret,The struggle is real😩Donezo🥩 (self.adultery),"I've had an AP for a yr and a half now. It's been great so far. Long distance AP. However, after our last vacation together, he started breadcrumbing me. It's been a few months of mixed signals, inconsistency and excuses. I made the decision to pull away this weekend. It's been rough. I know it's over. But he will never admit it to me. I have figured out he will continue to string me along indefinitely. He's probably hoping I come to the realization that he's not into this anymore and i will walk away. He's probably relieved I'm not reaching out, so he doesn't have to end it himself. But even as I asked him where we stood 3days ago, he swore he was still into me. I hate this. Men, the same energy you use to chase women, use half of it to end things amicably.

secret,So now I'm a terrible wife...🌬️Ventilation💨 (self.adultery),"Just a vent sesh about my marriage... Was going to post this in the marriage sub, but then thought some of those folks would take a look at my post history and call me a terrible wife due to that lol. I feel like I do a lot. Have the stable job in the household, save enough of our income to be able to cover things when, inevitably, he seems to lose his job every few years (not his fault though ::wink::), try to keep the house clean and organized (difficult when he leaves trash everywhere), plan the trips he complains about but ultimately has a good time during, etc. He does his part too generally, not going to say he doesn't. I am always pretty easy going and pleasant, even when being berated by him to not escalate things, especially in front of the kids. When he is in ""the mood"" give him what he's looking for and initiate when I am feeling it. Although it is usually when I'm having a good day due to other things and not related to him. Yet, I am somehow made to feel like I'm a terrible wife more often than not. We had a good father's day yesterday. I got him a new grill and catered to whatever else he wanted to do. But had promised some time with my son last night too, so upheld my word on that at the end of the day. Well, apparently that was the wrong move. I also am going on a trip for work that ends up overlapping his birthday, which I had invited him on and he declined, and now all of the sudden its this huuuge problem that is mentioned frequently with undertones that I am some kind of monster. I feel like every time I think things are starting to get better, they go back to the shitter in the blink of an eye. I'm starting to think maybe I am just unlovable and am doomed to this hellscape. I don't hate him, I don't hate anyone really, but I am really starting to reach my tipping point I think. Even this morning, I asked if he was trying to make me crack. He said he didn't know. Greeat. Getting this off my chest so I can start my week without feeling like shit. Makes me miss my exAP. Even if the end sucked terribly, at least I felt appreciated for a couple of months. Feeling lost lately, going to focus on kids and work for now. Happy Monday all!! Edit: thank you so much for the support! Really needed it today. It seems like a lot of you are going through something very similar. I'm glad to feel like I'm not the only one going through it, but also sad that this appears to be so common. Hopefully we all find our happiness in this life! It's waay too short to be so sad.",WealthAromatic9653,https://old.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/1lcppr6/so_now_im_a_terrible_wife/
secret,You Don't Know Until You Know🙌✨Good Vibes✨🙌 (self.adultery),"Once upon a time, when I initially began posting in this sub, I suppose my reason was similar to why I ended up at this place in my life. The search for connection. I found what I needed, and after a number of DMs, made the decision to share my journey here. In the past I've been able to sit down and the words would spill out onto the page, often in the form of unfiltered thoughts and raw emotion. At this stop along my path, however, I've found it to be a struggle. For a writer, that's endlessly frustrating. Feelings are a lot like pools of water. Crystal clear or murky. Calm or choppy. Shallow or deep. After my adventures of this past week, I've been swimming in the deep end of the pool, my fellow heathens. Life gets in the way sometimes. Meeting my AP took longer than either of us wanted. Probably more time than most people would've waited. Others might have given up and moved on. I never even considered it. How do you walk away from so much chemistry? From something where there's so much understanding of one another and you're drawn to them so strongly? If you're smart, you don't. You deal with the crap life keeps throwing at you, and keep hoping that the other person is willing to do the same. When you find someone you really click with online, there's no knowing how well that's going to translate into a real life encounter. If it takes as long as ours did to happen, there's so much time to fantasize and build it up in your mind. The phrase you don't know until you know bounced around in my head several times over the last week. Some things, my friends, are simply impossible to know until you experience them, but once you do.... Well, you may discover like I have that there are things even the most vivid imagination can't fully do justice to. No matter how many times I had envisioned it, there was no way to know how tender his kiss would be or how soft his hair would feel between my fingers. The way we'd kiss like we were making up for every kiss we should've shared before. I couldn't have predicted the things that would eventually come to feel etched into my brain. The way he looked stretched out in bed under the pale lights. The sound of need in his voice when he asked if he could taste me. His expression in the shower while I was washing his chest. What it was like to wake up in his arms. No daydream I had lived up to the reality of feeling the way his fingers trailed across my skin, or of laying my head on his chest, listening to his heartbeat and the sound of his breathing. I didn't have any idea how my hand would fit so perfectly in his. I couldn't have known just how affectionate he would be, the comfort and ease of being with him, or how safe I'd feel in his arms. We had 20+ hours together. As much as we wished we could make time stop and be together longer, we had to fully return to our lives. It was difficult for him to leave and for me to let him go. When the time came, I walked him to the door to say goodbye. He opened the door, reached down for his suitcase, and I grabbed the doorknob, pushing the door shut. I just couldn't let him go without one more kiss. To be honest, I started missing him the minute he left. Once he was gone, my hands were shaking as I immediately began doing a few things to distract myself, all while trying hard to fight a sudden urge to cry. When I finally stopped to pick up my phone, I had a message from him almost as soothing as his presence had been. I miss you already. Despite the sadness of having to part, I've been walking around in a fog for nearly a week. Last week I was moderately present in my real life, going through the motions while my mind was mostly consumed by the anticipation of meeting you. Now I'm moderately present in my real life, going through the motions while my mind is mostly consumed by remembering my time with you. The biggest notable differences are that I'm now constantly hiding a goofy little grin that's starting to make my cheeks hurt, and that my lips are a tiny bit chapped. That's what I told him a couple days ago. The time with him was magical, like it was all a wonderful dream. I'd wonder if it had been a dream if it weren't for him reminding me that it was real. I think that's part of why I've struggled to write about it. Finding the words to describe something so special can be a challenge. No matter which ones I choose, they feel inadequate. I'm also missing that enchanting man while writing this, craving his skin against mine. People so often talk about coming down from the highs. I won't say it's a cakewalk, but for me the process has been slow. Readjusting to reality has been gradual while reliving exquisite memories in my head. Until next time, he remains what he has been for quite some time: the good morning that makes me smile, the goodnight that makes my day complete, my favorite plot twist, the voice that sets my body on fire, and the kiss my lips are waiting for.",Susie_Secrets,https://old.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/1lclhrp/you_dont_know_until_you_know/
secret,What to do when ex-AP texts three years later?🙋‍♀️Question🙋‍♂️ (self.adultery),"UPDATE: I messaged her last night, and she responded later today. She said she thought of me last week and selfishly wanted to check in. We updated each other on our lives and struggles. I confess I was excited to be texting again. After about and hour, she explained she just wanted to see how I was doing and hoped that I found love in my relationship. She said I could reach out whenever I wanted to, but this wasn't a message to rekindle our relationship. I'm glad I messaged back, but sad that it was so quick. Felt like I got excited and let down all in a minor way. I left the chat with a message saying I'd love to chat more but the ball is in her court. Thanks for the advice everyone. I was overthinking things, as always. I had an online affair with a woman, call her T. Both married, she had a kid. It was a quick and intense affair - lots of chatting, video calls, plans to meet. Lasted maybe three months. One day she said she needed to end it. I said ok, deleted everything, and moved on. I was disappointed, but that’s the life. This was in 2022. Last week I get this text: “Hi there. I hope you don’t mind that I’m reaching out. How have you been?” Completely caught me off guard. I’ve been sitting on it. Not sure if I should respond. I’d love to talk to her again. She’s insanely attractive and we clicked on every level. But part of me worries that this could be a trap somehow? I’m an anxious person though.

secret,"Success, failure, redemption - follow up🦙Drama Llama🦙 (self.adultery)","I got a few questions from my last post. I’ll try to address those here and provide additional context. I’m 49, she is 36. I have kids, she does not, but we are both married. My daily schedule is fairly conventional. Hers is…less so. These life differences at first seemed like they could present some challenges to us. In fact, they did at first. When we met, it was the first affair for both of us. In hindsight, there was a bit of a learning curve for both of us, especially given our differences. The real learning was about ourselves and about our love for each other. And for those that wondered or suggested it, yes she knows about these posts! She knows these are odes to her and her love for me. I use the term girlfriend instead of AP for her because that is what she is to me. And she is my lover, my best friend, my confidante, my baby, my bunny, my chickadee, my fire, my laughter, my hope, my calmness, my excitement, my solace, my medicine, my energy, my hunger, my sweet nectar, my servant, my mistress, my naughty girl, and my good girl 😈. She belongs to me. Her incredibly responsive body, her amazing pussy, her mind, her heart, her everything, completely. And I belong to her, completely. She subjects herself entirely to my wishes and I do the same for hers. I’m her OG and she makes me feel like the baddest motherfucker around. Her beautiful eyes sparkle - I will never get enough of looking into them, especially when we have sex. Her eyes are filled with such love, desire and meaning. They tell me I’m where I need to be, and so is she. I don’t use the term AP anymore because I feel like that term belongs to the adultery “lifestyle” that is inherently jaded. No shade thrown here, I just don’t feel like I’m coming from the same place. Reading so many of the posts here, plus the affair ads, it seems like a hobby to many. I almost fell into that mindset, and so did she. We both were a bit jaded due to our mistakes with each other earlier. I realized that is not what I’m looking for. I want true, real, complete intimacy, fire, love, and friendship, and I found this in her. I don’t need to look any further. I’ve been asked how did I know when and how to say “I love you” to her. The truth is I waited far too long. I didn’t want to say it before because I was afraid it would have ripple effects on my life and hers. “Situation changing” implications. Plus in my life, love is not a word I’ve ever taken lightly. I treat it with reverence, always have. And I’m aware that some in this “lifestyle” throw the word around somewhat carelessly. That’s just not me. So when I decided to reach back out to her after our relatively brief time apart, I knew I needed to tell her. Circumstances weren’t exactly what I was hoping for when we reconnected, but we worked through it. And as part of working through it, I knew she needed to hear that I loved her. At first I danced around it, talking about my strong, deep feelings for her but stopping there. But then before we were officially back together, it got to the point where I knew I just needed to tell her. I told her I loved her, that I did before, and had never stopped. She told me that she felt the exact same way. It was a huge weight off my chest to tell her, and it seemed to open a floodgate for me, and for us. Our love for each other has gotten stronger every day since, even though we still had issues to work through in the first few weeks of reconnecting. There are still things to work through, but it gets easier and easier, and they are quickly and surely fading away. For the guys wondering when to tell their ladies that they love them…my answer is if you mean it, and you know it to be real, then tell her. Just tell her. Take the risk. What’s the real downside? That she doesn’t feel the same way? Then you should want to know sooner rather than later anyway, right? And the reality is, if you’re feeling it, in all likelihood she does too. You’ll have to judge whether the implications of saying it to each other are worth the risks. And the reality is, most women want/need to hear it from the man first. That’s just the way it is. As far as changing situations, mine is forever changed for the better. No I haven’t ended my marriage, and she hasn’t ended hers. But my situation, my life, is more full and complete with my lovely girlfriend in it. Yes there are complications due to it being an extramarital affair and the limitations we each have. But I know she’s in my corner, and I know she’s mine. She respects my circumstances, and I respect hers. What more can I really ask for? I got a couple of comments asking basically “what about your wife?” / “why do you choose to hurt your wife?,” at least one of which was removed by mods. Obviously there are some non-adulterers that browse this sub. My explanation for them is this: I’m here for a reason, and it’s not simply that I’m bored with my wife or my marriage. I am seeking, and have found, happiness that has never existed in my marriage, to be completely honest. So why not end my marriage now? Well because life is complicated and ending my marriage would not simply mean severing ties with my wife. It would create lots of other complications that I’m not willing to deal with at the moment. My girlfriend understands this and she has her own complications that I understand. In several weeks, we will have known each other for a year. Two to three of those months we spent apart. I am so incredibly glad and grateful she welcomed me back into her life. I have found incredible comfort and happiness with her. She is so damn special to me. Without her, I’d be here chasing happiness but not truly finding it. I love her so fucking much.",Equivalent_Road8804,https://old.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/1lcg5i8/success_failure_redemption_follow_up/
secret,Ran into ex-AP and wife😬Worse than it sounds!🙃 (self.adultery),"Background https://old.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/1kw48oh/affair_ended_im_miserable/ So husband and I went out for a light supper while our kids were at their youth program. Our server seats another couple, and it's my ex-AP and his wife. The way we're all seated, he and I can see each other, but our spouses can't see anything. I notice that he's looking pretty bad, lost some weight he couldn't afford to lose, and looks beaten down. I don't stare, just a couple of casual glances. He's studiously avoiding looking at me. I hear him start talking to his wife, and he's angry. Can't hear words, just tone. I get up and go to the bathroom so that I can make sure I'm in control of myself. First time I've seen him in almost 8 weeks. Someone comes into the bathroom while I'm in the stall. I come out, wash my hands, and there's AP's wife. She knows exactly who I am, calls me by name, and then tells me, ""It's nice to meet face to face"" before walking out. I thought I was going to throw up right there, could just see her walking up to my husband to tell him what went on between his wife and her husband. At this point, I go out and tell my husband I'm feeling sick and need to leave. I hear AP getting angry and cursing at his wife. I don't what she said to him. We go before she decides to get back at her husband by ruining my life. Part of me wants to know what she said to AP, if it was anything more than she knows that's me. Probably not. I know she's lied to me. For one, she told me when we had our phone call that ex-AP had fallen and broken his leg. He clearly didn't. I don't know how much of the crap she told me was real or not. So, I'm struggling now. It was a knife to the heart tonight. This man I loved, who I destroyed everything I believed in to be with, most likely hates me now. I don't know what she's told him I've said or if he actually does believe I betrayed him like she said. Couldn't betray him; his wife had all our texts and knew everything. 15 years I've lived in this town, and I've never ran into ex-AP in public before. Not to mention, he and his wife live in another town 20 miles away. Anyway, it gets better, right?",CrazyCora55,https://old.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/1lcfu1r/ran_into_exap_and_wife/
secret,Broken communication - is it my fault?🙋‍♀️Question🙋‍♂️ (self.adultery),"First time poster and won't divulge too much as I wouldn't want AP to find out. Lately I feel like our communication is broken. Initially we were texting and sexting all the time. The connection was incredible, and our sexual encounters unreal. It then became too much. I felt I had lost my mind and couldn't focus on anything else. I was barely sleeping and in a state of perpetual arousal. So I suggested reducing the frequency of messaging a little. I also suggested going no contact during AP's holiday, as I didn't want to ruin AP's couple's holiday. But ever since I feel like AP is pulling away, and it's tough. I feel even sillier as I'm the one who initiated the reduced frequency in the first place. Afraid I may have hurt AP's feelings. Also worried I keep sabotaging any nice relationships I have, by pushing them away whenever they get too close. Any advice is much appreciated.

secret,A dirty habit🚬 Smoky Thoughts🤔 (self.adultery),"I changed my brand of cigarettes. I never much liked B&H, but the taste of them in his mouth had much stronger effects on me than nicotine. His flavour, his scent, his essence. It’s addictive, intoxicating. My drug of choice. I inhale like it’s sustenance instead of poison filling my lungs. He was both of those things. I suck slowly, and blow gently, savouring, like I did when it was him between my lips. I love that the tendrils of smoke wrap around my curls and cling to my hair like his fingers did. I lose myself in the smoke clouds like I did in his bed sheets. I relive that night with every cigarette, desperate to feel smoke and him inside of me. My husband doesn’t smoke. Doesn’t like me smoking. He’s always been a square. But I have no sharp edges, I’m all curves. I adore the forbidden. I know it’s bad. I know I should quit.

secret,Message after 6 months.🧠Thoughts🤔 (self.adultery),"My (F) AP (M)and I met July last year. I was in an open relationship and he was having an affair. The connection was fire both physically and mentally, he lived near me so we were able to meet frequently. We were both everything each-other needed at that point of our lives. However The guilt got to him a lot and he would pull away, (be slow to message, find excuses to avoid seeing each-other) for a time. Then come back. It was painful but I understood the reason. When we were together it was perfect, then he’d be so distant on the messages. “Sorry It’s been a busy day, because almost a daily copy paste on his end” When I went on an overseas business trip in december he blocked me on our message app, deleted me off other apps and that was that. It was heartbreaking but I guess it made sense. A few days ago he sent me a message via social Media and we had a chat. He was wondering how I was and says he thinks about me a lot. I’ve invited him to catch up for a vanilla after work drink, which he said he would very much like, and then said his dog was sick and never replied back after a few days. Still waiting for a message back. I’m so so excited about seeing him again but it looks like he is still in the same habits. I’m trying really hard to not appear desperate, I’m tempted to Message him. But also I shouldn’t let this affect me. I mean the way he blocked me, he should be trying to move the earth to want to spend time with me. I guess im just here to get some motivation on what to do.

secret,Feeling lost in the in-between — is it time to walk away?🙋‍♀️Question🙋‍♂️ (self.adultery),"Hey all — long-time lurker, first-time poster. I’m hoping to get advice from people who’ve lived through the highs and lows of an affair and can help me get some perspective. I’ve been in an emotional and sexual affair for several months now. He’s in a relationship and I’m married and in a stable-but-emotionally-bland marriage where intimacy has been DOA for a while. My AP and I quickly escalated — emotionally and physically — and the sex has been electric. He says he’s addicted to my body, I’m constantly on his mind, etc. For a while we were texting constantly, getting deep, sharing our inner worlds, but lately… not so much. Over the last few weeks, he’s felt checked out. Conversations lean more sexual and less emotional, responses are slower, and I feel like everything happens on his timing. He still sends flirty texts, still says he wants me, but when it comes to making plans or emotionally showing up, I’m left hanging more often than not. When I try to pull back, he drops just enough breadcrumbs to reel me back in — a flirty emoji, a hot comment, a reminder of our connection. And I fall for it, because I’m craving the high. But the emotional rollercoaster is starting to outweigh the thrill. I don’t know if he’s avoidant, just overwhelmed balancing everything, or losing interest. And I don’t know if I’m still in this for fun, validation, or something deeper I won’t get. I’ve thought about ending it but I’m scared of the low that’ll follow. I haven’t felt this alive in years. Anyone been here? How did you know it was time to walk away? Did anyone actually end it and feel peace, not just heartbreak? I’d love to hear your experiences — the real, messy, honest kind.",Spirited-Check8599,https://old.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/1lbtu3f/feeling_lost_in_the_inbetween_is_it_time_to_walk/
secret,I Miss Her🌬️Ventilation💨 (self.adultery),"Why does falling in love as an adult feel so crazy powerful? Anyway... I (47 M) usually do a decent job of having nice feelings and avoiding love... just couldn't help it with this one. She wanted a slow burn... all the emotional + sex chat + all the personality traits (good and bad) that hit just right... all the feelings hit right as things slowed way down... I realized I was probably the one going crazy (wanting more than she could give) and moved on. But, I'd be lying if I said my heart moved on. My whole body is in pain. I can't post r4r posts... had a previous FWB that I can't bring myself to see right now... had that once-in-a-blue-moon spouse sex that sucked sooooo bad... physically wanting to puke & break out into a huge sob of despair ha ha ha. Not funny, but, if you've been there you know. I miss the way she felt... I second guess everything I said... she set a new bar for future AP that I'm not sure can be met... considering just giving up on this affair world... but I know I won't be able to... beautiful, smart, great sense of humor... sweet kisses... felt amazing in my arms...

secret,Please talk to me about adultery as lifestyle VS divorce🙋‍♀️Question🙋‍♂️ (self.adultery),"I appreciate if you guys share your personal experience or ideas, I need opinions and points of view on the topic. Here is my story. I've been a loyal wife for 15 years. When situation gradually became unbearable (dead bedroom, lack of emotional connection, narcissist behavior of my SO) I made up my mind that I needed to get a divorce. At that moment and now I couldn't do it because of financial dependence but I decided to work on my financial independence and meanwhile allowed myself to cheat in order to make life more bearable. After that I met some awesome people, made friends and had great sex with them. Life became much more bearable, I really enjoy my life now. That's why I have started thinking... Maybe I don't need a divorce? Even with a relevant financial independence, single life would be much harder from financial point of view than family one. I won't be able to buy an accomodation by myself. and we had kids who also would struggle from a separation. On the other hand I am still irritated by my husband's behavior, dreaming of waking up alone and think that cheating is basically a bad thing. Unfortunately to speak openly to him and open the marriage is not an option with him (who knows narcissists, can understand why). Please, share your point of view. Deep inside I hope that you guys will teach me how to save this marriage (keep cheating, not getting a dicorce), accept the situation and explain to me why it is more beneficial for everyone. Or explain me why it is always better to leave...",notgonnabeeasysorry,https://old.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/1lbr3ws/please_talk_to_me_about_adultery_as_lifestyle_vs/
secret,To Break Up or Not to Break Up🙋‍♀️Question🙋‍♂️ (self.adultery),"I’ve had an AP for about a year and a half. We agreed to leaving emotions out of it and have had great sexual chemistry. We definitely fill a void for each other in that regard since our significant others both have low libidos. Everything was great until the past few months. I feel like he’s bread crumbing me. Communication is less and meet ups are also much less frequent. In addition, I started feeling emotionally attached and knew that this wasn’t part of the deal. All signs point that it’s time to end things. When I broke up with him, I expected him to be bummed out and a little hurt, but at the same time, expected he would want to go no contact in order to not risk his wife finding anything out. After all, there aren’t supposed to be any feelings involved. The opposite happened. He was pretty upset that I was breaking things off and felt like he had been giving me a lot of effort (he wasn’t). He also admitted that he doesn’t want to lose me in his life, which surprised me because his actions the past few months are the opposite. I told him I would take some time and think about things. Is he more attached than I think he is or is he saying things just to keep me around?

I feel both of us have just stopped gaf about effort but haven't officially ended it. I said something to him about ending it. And he was like no don't end it. Not forever. 🙄 I get passive aggressive bc im just over him. And I had a week away on a family trip. Very little cell service and im just like meh. Idc anymore. Not like I want him to die.

secret,I did it - took the plunge post-break up!🧠Thoughts🤔 (self.adultery),"I had a long-term relationship that came to an end in a very disappointing way, and I was struggling hard. Although I kept telling myself to accept that it was really over, I couldn’t move past it. There was a date that I thought he would reach out, so when that date came and went, I finally sat with it. It’s over. I let myself feel some more feelings, then the next day I got back on the horse and posted my first ad in several years. It was strange coming up to speed on the different things that have changed and realizing how I have changed too. But that actually ended up being the thing that’s truly helped. I thought about what worked and what didn’t work in my last relationship, and I’m seeing a lot of places where I compromised because I loved my AP so much. I was giving up a lot more than I realized, and chatting with new people confirmed that what I needed wasn’t unreasonable. I wasn’t asking for too much. It’s ok that my ex couldn’t give me certain things, but it’s also ok for me to need and ask for them. I’m excited for the first time in who knows how long by the idea of being wanted for who I am and to not worry that doing so will overwhelm someone. I hope other people who are feeling distraught over their break ups will see this and know there is light at the end of the tunnel!

secret,My gut knew. I just didn’t want to believe it until today😩Donezo🥩 (self.adultery),"Your gut is usually right. Mine was screaming. I should’ve listened. We all have those moments when something deep inside tells us the truth before we’re ready to accept it. Today, I finally learned my lesson. If you’re still lurking or if you ever read this, you’ll know this is for you. I should have known. The first red flag? You lied about your age. The second? You lied about your posting habits. I saw the signs, but I chose to believe the fantasy instead of trusting my instincts. I had a feeling you were still on Telegram. When I wrote that ad yesterday, something inside me knew you’d respond. And when you did, I knew instantly it was you. I hope you felt sick when you realized it was me. I saw your new Reddit account. The comments. The posts. The women. It wasn’t real for you. It was real for me. For two weeks, I held onto hope. I truly believed you might come back. Your last words to me were “I love you.” And I believed you. I loved you. And you played me. I wish you had let me go from the beginning. But you didn’t. You pulled me in and made me believe it was safe to fall. You won. You got someone to fall for you. I hope that gave you the high you were chasing. You were smooth. You said all the right things. You knew exactly how to make someone feel seen. You played the game well. But I’ve spiraled over you for the last time. You left me with nothing, not even my dignity. I gave that away in every embarrassing message I sent while missing you. Begging you to pick me. In every tear I cried. This isn’t all your fault, your actions told me you didn’t want me. I just wish your words had done the same. But I see it all so clearly now. There will be no more I miss you. No more pictures. No more phone calls just to hear your voice. No more I love you. There will be no Boston in the summer but I think you always knew that. No need to worry, I'm going to pick myself up and move on like you never existed.

My relationship has been rocky even before marriage but we made it to marriage. I had been feeling lonely in this marriage for quite some time. He would be emotionally distant, frequently drunk, avoidant to conversations. He would just say a quick ""sorry"" just to shut me up and tell me to drop anything i was trying to talk to him about. We moved to a new city so I didn't have friends or company. He would regularly go out with his new friends and hardly make time for me to go on dates or spend time. Even once a month was enough for him. I felt emotionally and sexually frustrated because he would be satisfied with sex just once in a week or even two weeks, which wasnt enough for me. Even if I kissed him passionately, he would stop me. I felt really lonely and neglected. So I was browsing some random sites to talk to people not necessarily a sexual one. Just casual conversations. But I met this guy who's great. We talk for hours. We banter and joke. I feel seen and heard and admired. We exchange nudes and talk about explicit stuff. He's into the stuff that I am which my husband would never even think of trying. I feel bad but i really can't stop.

You see glimpses of their life—family vacations, celebrations, moments you can’t be part of. You can’t call whenever you want, or spend time with them freely. You’re left waiting, hoping for the next time you’ll see them. Always waiting. I miss how things used to be. Back then, he would drive three to four hours every week just to be with me. We talked regularly. He made time. I never had to beg for his presence. He wanted to be there. I felt chosen. Now, 2.5 years later, everything feels different. I rarely see him. Plans get canceled last minute. The connection we had—it feels like it’s slipping away, and it breaks my heart. We've talked about this, and he told me that he's just really busy. I love him deeply, and I don’t want to lose what we have.

Alle die großen Bildern in mir, im Fernen erfahrene Landschaft, Städte und Türme und Brücken und un- vermutete Wendung der Wege und das Gewaltige jener von Göttern einst durchwachsenen Länder: steigt zur Bedeutung in mir deiner, Entgehende, an. Ach, die Gärten bist du, ach, ich sah sie mit solcher Hoffnung. Ein offenes Fenster im Landhaus—, und du tratest beinahe mir nachdenklich heran.

confession,I think I'm being too possesssive over my friend. (self.offmychest),"I'm going to make this quick, I'm one year older than my friend, we are both females. Lately she's been texting another guys whom she's met in a group of friends. She's been telling me about how long they've been texting, even sharing screenshots of text messages from multiple people. Both from the guy and a few of her other friends who are telling her that he likes her. I can't tell if she likes him or not. If I'm going to be honest I don't care if she does, I don't care if the guy has a crush on her either. I'm not against them being in a romantic relationship. Although, I can't help but feel jealous. The guy is older than me by a few months and judging by the screenshots of their conversation she's been sending me, he's basically me. We both have the same speech, and even through texting we text the same. A constant thought that has been lingering in my head is ""If I were a guy, would you like me?"" We've always been close and always got a long, shes a really close friend of mines. We write letters to eachother, text eachother daily, send eachother voice messages, and we always compare our friendship to fictional gay ships we both enjoy. The letters also often contain love notes, she always writes about how much she loves me, how important I am to her, even referring to me as her treasure. We flirt with eachother through texts, calling eachother pet names, planning a future together and maybe it's just another close platonic girl friendship and I might just be confused but I fear that I'm starting to develop feelings and I'm denial over it. For the record, I've always identified as straight and this the the first time I've felt like this over a friend, I'm still trying to explore my sexuality but I feel like I'm being selfish for being jealous and not supporting my friend, if she does like this guy I would want to feel incredibly happy for her but this is really bothering me and I just need to let it out there.",leylotpot,https://old.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1lhjzz1/i_think_im_being_too_possesssive_over_my_friend/

Immer wenn ich in eine Situation komme, in der ich mit anderen Menschen irgendwie „ausgeliefert“ bin – zum Beispiel beim gemeinsamen Essen oder beim Friseur – kriege ich plötzlich starke Schweißausbrüche. Es ist nicht nur ein bisschen nervöses Schwitzen, sondern richtig unangenehm: Rücken, Hände, manchmal sogar Stirn. Ich spüre förmlich, wie mein Körper in Alarmbereitschaft geht, obwohl objektiv gar keine Gefahr da ist. Was das Ganze noch schlimmer macht: Ich fange dann an, genau das zu fürchten – dass ich wieder schwitze. Und natürlich passiert es dann erst recht. Es ist wie ein Teufelskreis. Ich wirke dann wahrscheinlich total verkrampft oder seltsam, was meine Angst noch mehr befeuert. Ich schäme mich dafür, obwohl ich weiß, dass ich mir das nicht ausgesucht habe. Aber ich frage mich echt: Warum ist sowas wie beim Friseur sitzen oder mit Kollegen essen gehen für mich so ein Ausnahmezustand? Ich fühle mich dann wie ein Alien.

And then, less than two months ago, my ex I never got over reached out only to give mixed signals and mess with my feelings ""wanting to be friends."" Its hard not to be depressed or self-pitying. I still get up, I go to work, I stay active and even social. But at the end of the day I know the only two people who loved me are gone and I'm facing this all alone, and I'm so tired of being ""strong.""",No_Event432,https://old.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1lhjupj/throwing_a_pity_party_for_a_sec/
confession,“God didn’t create humans. Humans created God.” (self.offmychest),"I used to believe. Not because I truly understood God — but because I was told to, like most people around me. But slowly, I began asking the questions no one wants to hear: Why do powerful people commit crimes and walk free, while poor people suffer and pray their whole lives? Why does karma seem to work only in movies, not real life? Why is it considered wrong to question faith — even when religion is used to manipulate people? And more importantly: Why do people follow God with fear, guilt, and obedience — not with reason? I started noticing how priests, sadhus, and spiritual “gurus” profit by claiming to speak to God — but they never have real answers. Just vague phrases like “God is testing you” or “Everything happens for a reason.” These aren’t answers. They’re just coping mechanisms — shortcuts to avoid the pain of not knowing why bad things happen. I don’t believe humans were created by God. I believe humans created God — to fill the unbearable silence behind life’s toughest questions. Who made us? Why do we suffer? What happens after death? Instead of accepting “we don’t know,” we invented stories. And interestingly, we gave these gods human names, faces, emotions, and even families — as if we couldn’t imagine a divine being without making it look and behave like us. Religion gives power to those who claim to represent it. In ancient India, even some Brahmins claimed divine connection to control society. Today, religion is still used — in courts, in schools, in elections — not for truth, but for control. What’s worse is being told that doubting God is dangerous — as if thinking deeply is some kind of sin. I’ve faced struggles I never deserved. That’s when I realized: Karma isn’t watching. God isn’t protecting. Morality is just human psychology. And sometimes I wonder if even what we call ""good"" or ""bad"" is just our brain judging another brain — because when someone commits a crime, their own mind often justifies it, while ours condemns it. There’s no divine verdict — just human perception. I’m not writing this to offend anyone. I’m just tired. Tired of being told to believe in something without proof. Tired of watching blind faith control people’s lives. Tired of feeling alone with these thoughts in a society that labels doubt as danger. Has anyone else felt this way? Or am I the only one quietly burning with these thoughts?",confusedPotato156wbt,https://old.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1lhjujb/god_didnt_create_humans_humans_created_god/
confession,Arabs are the most privileged group (self.offmychest),"They're white looking and attractive but portrayed as a ""poor brown muslim"" despite coming from rich countries. On the other hand indians even at their poorest would always be demonized by the media for casteism, and just generally mocked. Arabs enslaved black people using their religion as a basis but because their religion isn't defined by others as every single text written in its name in existence they get off scot free. They still practise slavery against black Africans today. Groups historically persecuted by muslims have to reimagine muslims as the historically aggrieved community to coddle them and by extension Arabs who take full advantage of it. India is an example where the muslim minority have been given systematic extreme special treatment and power over the narrative and negative things that happen to them amplified while negative things that happen to the majority downplayed and white Arabs keep using it to bolster their feelings of grievance.

confession,I don't want to go to school. (self.offmychest),"Right now, we just started classes, but I'm already overwhelmed. Before the start of the class, I thought I'll do just fine... but I didn't. In fact, it worsened. Meeting other people just worsened my anxiety. I mean, people also get anxiety before meeting people because, like, who knows what they are thinking? I socialised even just a little bit, but it worsened. Everything worsened. I don't want to do anything school-related stuff. I feel like I'm pushing myself further if I do those. I would likely become more miserable if I forced myself. I don't have any motivation or any care if I fail... I want to rest. Even if I would just lay all day, I would still be exhausted. I hate myself for it. My mother would accuse me as lazy, she's right, I am. But... I can't tell them what I'm feeling... history will just repeat. Back then, I told my mother I wanted to commit... she gave me a knife and said, ""Do it."" No one really helped me back then. I mean, I isolated myself. My classmates are asking about my situation or how am I... I don't want anyone to know what I'm going through. I don't want to be a burden... they're already stressed enough. They might say, ""Everyone feels that way."" Maybe... but doesn't mean that I'm going to be alright after someone told me that. In fact, it's the opposite. People just ignore the problem until it's too late. That's what I'm afraid for. I'm already misunderstood and ignored. No one will take me seriously. Not even my parents. They would just tell me their whole life history... that they went through worse situations than I am. That I shouldn't think of those things. I wish it's that easy. I can't just turn on or off my mind about negative thoughts. Even for no reason, I felt down and sometimes empty. The only things that kept me going are through writing and music. I'm afraid that everything will repeat again. My parents would forcefully tell me to go to school through verbal and by pulling me towards the doorway. I hope they won't see this... I still care for them... but they don't just help. ""You literally do nothing aside from going to school. That's the only thing you'll do, and you can't even do it? What about your future? You'll just be abused when you're an adult. You don't know anything... we'll just leave you alone. You did this to yourself. It's such a small thing, and you're thinking those? How would you survive without us?"" They're right. But these feelings just came when you least expect it. You can't focus. You lose interest. Everything felt dull. People would ignore your problems... because you're the problem. No, it's the mind between me and my mind. I wish I could eat without anyone telling me, ""You're all bones... you should eat more."" Do they really want me to be unhealthy? I can manage myself. But when it's about these feelings... they can't help me at all. Due to that, I don't easily tell anyone what I'm feeling. Isolation made me a little better with no expectations. Now that it's all returning... I'm afraid of what will happen again. For anyone who's suffering the same, you're not alone. You're a human, and it's valid to feel those. People ignore what they can't understand. You're already strong enough to get through this far. Darkness will go soon. And if that happened, be proud of yourself. You're brave and worthy. Don't forget that.",Born-Estate-8542,https://old.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1lhjkg5/i_dont_want_to_go_to_school/
confession,"I’ve been struggling for years, but I never felt like I was allowed to talk about it (self.offmychest)","I’ve been struggling for a long time. Probably since I was a kid. I don’t think anyone has ever really listened to me, and maybe part of that is my fault. I’ve never asked anyone to. I’ve always kept my problems to myself because, well… they’re mine, right? And it’s not like anyone ever made space for them anyway. Even my mom doesn’t take me seriously. I’m an only child, and whenever I try to open up—even just a little, she either laughs or brushes it off. She’s never validated how I feel. So over time, I guess I stopped expecting anyone to care. I just carry it all on my own. But lately I’ve realized… I can’t even remember the last time I felt genuinely happy for a whole week straight. That kind of happiness just doesn’t happen for me anymore. And I think I’m tired. Not the kind of tired that goes away with sleep. Just tired of holding everything in, of pretending I’m okay when I’m really not. Maybe my problems aren’t as serious as what some people go through, but I still feel broken in the way that I do. Maybe I was just born more sensitive, I’ve always kind of felt that way. Things seem to affect me deeply, even when I try to hide it. Last night, I went to a bar with my friends. Toward the end of the night, everyone got a bit emotional and started opening up about their lives. A lot of them talked about really painful things, family issues, abusive relationships, and I just sat there, mostly listening. I didn’t say much because honestly, I felt like my problems didn’t compare. Like they weren’t “serious enough.” But that doesn’t mean I’m not hurting too.",anuglyfairybutafairy,https://old.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1lhjc8j/ive_been_struggling_for_years_but_i_never_felt/
confession,My younger brother's classmates are calling each other and the girls misogynistic slurs in public (self.offmychest),"They're around 13~14(we have a large age gap). Their voices haven't even broken yet. Yet my younger brother told me that the boys in his class were mocking each other and the girls by calling them 'slts' 'hes' 'pssy hair btch', etc. Loudly. In public. He told me that the convenience store lady glared at them. And also that they say it in class loudly too, but only when the more quiet male teacher is there. Not the teacher they are scared of. I just..these are literal kids. And yet they already absorbed this language. And are saying it in public. I feel really bad for the girls.

confession,(20m) I’m still obsessed with her (self.offmychest),"(I’m Italian, and this is my first time ever posting, so apologies if I make any grammatical mistakes.) In the summer of 2023, I met a girl during a group hangout with some friends — let’s call her Diana. At first, I thought she was annoying. But over the next few months, I saw her again a couple of times at parties. During those events, we talked, joked, and teased each other nonstop, and I started to notice a really strong chemistry between us. Still, at the time, I was hopelessly into someone else — the girl who would soon become my first girlfriend — so I completely ignored any of Diana’s approaches, often acting cold (I later found out she had a crush on me back then). Fast forward to March 2024: the day after getting dumped by my girlfriend, Diana showed up at one of my volleyball matches (she was dragged there by some friends). That day I was emotionally wrecked and didn’t feel like talking to anyone, so I pretended not to notice her. Later that evening, she texted me first — and honestly, partly because I was amused by how persistent she was, I decided to go along with it. We ended up texting every day and night. In May, she drove two hours just to come watch me play in a tournament. She cheered for me all day while wearing my hoodie (which she had “stolen” while I wasn’t paying attention). A few weeks later, we had our first one-on-one date: we went to the movies. It went really well — halfway through the movie, she lay down on me and rested her head on my chest. I put my arm around her, and we stayed like that until the end of the film. When it was time to say goodbye, she hugged me and looked into my eyes for a moment, but I didn’t have the courage to kiss her. In the following weeks, we kept texting, but we couldn’t manage to meet up again — sometimes it was my fault, sometimes hers. Eventually, in July, we went our separate ways (I should mention that there was a chance I might be moving away for good that summer — which didn’t happen in the end). In August, missing her, I tried to break the silence with a silly joke, but she responded coldly. I took that as a sign to step back and focus on myself. And it was working… until October, when she suddenly liked one of my Instagram stories. I ignored it, but she started creeping back into my mind. A few weeks later, out of nowhere, she messaged me and reopened the conversation. At first, I acted cold — I was scared of getting hurt again — but after a few days, I opened up a bit, and she quickly asked me to grab a coffee. It went terribly: she arrived an hour late (though she stayed on the phone with me the whole time while coming), and I spilled our coffees, though she actually laughed it off. Still, I realized during that outing that even though our conversation still flowed, there was now a bit of a wall between us. Eventually, the texts faded again. About a week later, we both had volleyball games in the same gym. We agreed that whoever finished first would go watch the other play. I finished first and went to watch her match. But when I approached her afterward, a male friend of hers came over, and she introduced us. I didn’t know at the time that they were just friends, so I convinced myself she had moved on and only saw me as a friend now. That night, we chatted a bit — it still felt easy and playful — but I didn’t pick the conversation back up afterward. And neither did she. About a month later, we crossed paths at a professional match, but we just waved from a distance (we even pretended not to see each other at first). At Christmas, I found the courage to wish her happy holidays, but she replied coldly again, so I decided to leave her alone for good. Then in April 2025, we crossed paths again at another match. This time, I waved at her best friend, who was sitting next to her, and Diana turned her back and ignored me completely. I was hurt, so when I passed by her later, I ignored her too — and decided to move on for real. But in mid-May, out of the blue, she liked a photo I posted with my mom (there’s a running inside joke about my mom between us — long story). A few days later, since it was her birthday, I decided to send her a message, but kept it short and cold. She replied with a thank-you… and a heart emoji (which she doesn’t usually do when she’s being cold). Two weeks later, I got a follow request from her best friend on Instagram. Now it’s June 20th. I’ve liked a couple of her “Close Friends” Instagram stories — nothing personal, just neutral content (she never removed me from Close Friends, by the way). But honestly, I don’t think I have the courage to message her. Part of me wants to move on, but the awareness that nothing ever really happened between us — despite the amazing chemistry (which she also pointed out once) — keeps pulling my thoughts back to her. And the fact that we both remained single all this time isn’t helping. Any advice is welcome.",Jaleck_Parat,https://old.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1lhj8h8/20m_im_still_obsessed_with_her/
confession,Ghosted after two years by a FWB (self.offmychest),"Yes, it’s embarrassing. I know. I met him when I was 23, and I was going through a really rough time in my life. I was dealing with abuse from family members, had just left a physically and sexually abusive relationship, and was still healing from childhood trauma. We met on Bumble, and he talked to me nicely — I guess that was enough for me at the time, after dealing with so much negativity. We agreed to meet and start a friends-with-benefits situation. When we first met, he was really nice. It caught me off guard how kind he seemed, and I guess I just felt “safe” around him. I did notice some red flags, but me being unhealed at the time… I ignored them. I noticed he would talk about himself a lot — our conversations were always about him. That made me feel conflicted, but again, I let it slide. It started with little things. I’d wear a certain perfume, and after dropping me home, he’d text me saying it was too strong and lingered on his sheets, asking me not to wear it again. Another time, he accused me of stealing one of his condoms. I told him I had zero reason to do that — I’m a woman, and I’m not hoarding random protection. 🙄 He could be nitpicky, and sometimes he’d take days — even a week — to respond to my texts. My self-worth was so low, I didn’t even realize how much I was tolerating. I’d check in on him, give him advice, listen to him vent about his depression… but he never supported me through mine. He never checked in on me. He never listened to me. I was always pouring into him, but now that I look back, he never once poured into me. Still, for some reason, I stayed wrapped up in him. One New Year’s Eve, I asked if he wanted to come over and spend a couple of hours together. He said it sounded like a great idea… and then, last minute, he texted that he’d rather work instead to make money. I told him that was fine, and he just hearted the message. He never even texted the next day to wish me a Happy New Year. He only texted me when he wanted to see me for sex. I was romanticizing a situation that barely existed. I don’t know what it was that I saw in him, but that moment of “safety” in the beginning had me so wrapped up. So much so that two years passed — and I didn’t even realize it. Between the pain of my own life, healing from trauma, and my mom and sister ganging up on me and discouraging me from finishing college… my energy was drained. Those two years flew by. Eventually, I started waking up to the fact that he wasn’t giving me anything. No effort. No reciprocation. I finally told him I needed more stability, and I even admitted I had a crush on him. He just brushed it off and said, “Boo. That sucks. Well, I’m flattered and I wish you the best.” In a nutshell, he basically told me that as long as we weren’t hooking up, that was the end of the road. Still, I held onto him. I kept thinking about our conversations, how safe he made me feel in the beginning — I guess it was just my low self-worth. A couple of months passed, and there was an earthquake in my state. I texted him saying I was scared and asked if he’d heard about it. He just sent one message: “Yeah, it’s on the news. I saw it. You should check Google for more info.” And that was it. More months passed. Three days before my birthday, we were having a flirty conversation. I sent him a playful message and, for the first time in the years I knew him, a suggestive photo of myself. He’d never asked for pictures, and I’d never sent any before. He said I looked good and joked about wanting to meet up. I agreed… and after that, I never heard from him again. He ghosted me — three days before my birthday. Never even wished me Happy Birthday, even though I texted him every year on his. Then I saw on social media that he was at a restaurant with another girl, in another state. To say I was devastated is an understatement. I know we weren’t in a committed relationship, and technically he didn’t “owe” me anything. But it still hurt so badly. The pain of not seeing my own worth crushed me. I spiraled into a deep depression — not just because of him, but because of everything. I thought about every abusive relationship I’d been in. My friend who passed away. My aunt who had just passed in April. I was so broken by her sudden death that I impulsively texted and called him, saying I really needed someone. I said I was really needing somebody. He never answered. Never picked up. Three days later, he was posting on social media like nothing happened — smiling at restaurants, promoting his music, laughing. I started to hate him. Truly hate him. And I hated myself for allowing someone to humiliate me like that. It made life feel meaningless. My already-existing mental health struggles spiraled. I didn’t want to be here anymore. I felt so stupid — so foolish — for feeling that sad over someone I didn’t even date. I kept thinking, You should’ve seen the signs. What was wrong with you? And I know some of you might say the same thing. It’s been a year since it happened, and I still cry. I cry when I think about how I ignored all the signs of emotional unavailability. I cry when I remember that he never gave closure. He never reached out. When I told him I needed someone, he saw the message and continued posting on social media like I didn’t exist. That hurts. I’m not gonna pretend it doesn’t — just because we were “just” friends with benefits. I’m not posting this for pity. I just want a little encouragement, maybe some advice on how to truly heal from this. I know I was dumb — I don’t need to hear that part. I just need help figuring out how to be better. 🥺🤍",Important_Ad_7196,https://old.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1lhj7u2/ghosted_after_two_years_by_a_fwb/
confession,I hate my Dad (self.offmychest),Throw away because my siblings are on reddit. I dont know who else to talk about with this and obviously i just need to throw it in a void I hate my dad. I can't admit it to my step mom because it'll break her heart she hates it when im mean to him because it hurts her feelings but I can't handle it anymore. I feel bad because I dont know if im being dramatic because teenage shit but damn I hate him. He's an alcoholic he has been my enitre life there have been multiple occasions where he has chosen alcohol over bringing food or and water home ( where i live we have bad tap water and it isnt very safe to drink long term). I just can't forgive him for so many things when I was younger for one instance my older brother would threaten to kill me ( like hed bite me beat me and run around with a knife little 9 year old me was scres shitless) and I'd lock myself in a closet for hours begging him to come home or tell him to stop and all he does is come home and tell at us for misbehaving ( he was at a work Christmas party). I also believe hes jealous of me whenever I bring up achievements or cool things I do he has to one up me or whenever i make plans with my step mom to do something ( like go to the mall or whatever) he gets pissy like were leaving him out ( mind you they spend almost everyday together ). I just cant find it in my heart to look at him and be like yea thats my dad. The part of me that is him I dread. I'm scared of becoming an addict like him. I can't even enjoy alcohol without binging after I drink i actually have to put my mind to not doing it again its something my body naturally wants and I fucking blame him ( even if it isn't his fault it im still mad hes an addict). This past year he got into a car accident and he got let go of his job because of it. He's fine but fuck I can't trust him he wasn't found at fault for thr accident ( he was t boned ) but I knew if they for some reason they tested his blood alcohol levels he'd be blow red. That's the worst part for me I cant trust him he lies i see him lie to his wife to his kids to me to other people he fucking lies and I hate it when he lies. I dont like being in cars when he drives I dont know how much hes drunken. one time he had a split shift st his new job he came home drank then WENT BACK TO WORK. At this point I dont care i dont care about him hes disappointed me over and over hes never there for me hes always in bed or drinking. I've tried to tell my step mom he could he depressed and we should get him help but then im a dramatic bad guy. so now I refuse i dont care I hate him.

confession,I'm Having My Incarcerated Ex Served With a Petition of Parental Rights and Step-Parent Adoption (self.offmychest),"Throw away for peace of mind. I've deleted all my social media since hiring our attorney and needed to scream into the void. The last few weeks have brought back so much bullshit I had packed away in the condemned storage unit that is my psyche. This is more for me to document this super fun new ride but if anyone takes the time to read this and offer some advise and/or encouragement, you're so very appreciated. My child's father started using drugs and became very abusive which caused our separation. In 2020, I was granted sole legal and physical custody. He has been absent since 2019, in prison since 2022 after spending all of 2021 hiding from a felony drug warrant or in jail, awaiting trial for vehicular theft. 6 years of no support, no parental duties, 0 birthday cards, absolutely no contact with my child. In my state, all the grounds for abandonment were met years ago. I married my husband 3 years ago. He is an amazing father my child and the only father my child knows. In my state, if the child is 12+ years old, the child must agree to their adoption. We had originally planned on waiting until then. However, I am terrified that if something happened to me before then, that my child would be placed in foster care, or worse, given to his biological father when he's released, and my husband left fighting that battle alone. So we had an age appropriate conversation with our child and found an attorney. The petition has been filed, just waiting on him to be served. I know he'll try to fight this. I know to some it looks like I'm still finding ways to punish my ex. I know that no matter what he did back then and since, the judge may decide to deny the petition. I hope the judge sees that I'm not doing this out of vindictiveness, that I'm not preventing my child from knowing their biological father. I have worked very hard to build a stable, loving and healthy home. Everything I have done has been to give my children a better start in life and a better future. I just want my child's wellbeing protected. The petty part of me does wish that being served will send my ex into psychotic episode that screws his eventual parole eligibility and forces him to remain incarcerated for his full sentence satisfaction, because fuck that guy.",throwaway7886536,https://old.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1lhj5pw/im_having_my_incarcerated_ex_served_with_a/

confession,Fell for my Direct Report (self.offmychest),"Want to get this off my chest that’s it, since I can’t talk about it with anyone. Hired someone around 1.5 years ago. In the beginning our interactions were normal-professional, and then we started going out for dinner, drinks. Business trips which we extended to hang out. Shared our deepest secrets, eventually became great friends. Best friends. Somewhere along those lines, fell for her. Hard. Waiting for the work day to start, hard. Hating weekends, hard. Can’t imagine life without her, hard. I am happily married for 4 years so I am not gonna act on it. And even if I wasn’t married, she has a boyfriend. Moot point.

confession,A whole group of people hate me (F20) for dating my boyfriend (M20) (self.offmychest),"So back in November, I (F20) met a guy (M23) through Instagram and we hung out for a while as friends. He would invite me over to hangout, go to parties, clubs, etc. Over time I met a bunch of people. I became close with a couple of them and acquaintances with others. In December, he hosted a Christmas party and I was introduced to my now boyfriend (M20) to which I barely remember him being there because he had a girlfriend (F21) so I didn’t pay him any mind. I also was introduced to a couple of girls who seemed nice (ranging from 21-24). Then in late January, a friend group formed around this group, guys and girls, and they would mostly go out to local bars or shows and sometimes hangout at each other’s apartments and drink. At first, I wasn’t even being invited to these small events, only big parties, even though we had all become friends at the same time. Of course I felt a little left out, but it wasn’t a big deal. Eventually, one of the girls (F22), we will call her R, invited me out to the bar with them and I went. We all started hanging out pretty consistently but they all felt much closer to each other than they did to me. My boyfriend and the girl he was dating at the time, we will call her A, were apart of this friend group, but he wouldn’t come around every time because he had work and whenever he was around he was just very quiet and kept to himself mostly. There were a few instances where I would go to pick her up because she lived close to me, but we were very different and it felt like one of those friendships where you guys are really only friends because of a friend group. I had really only felt close to one of the girls because we had hung out outside of the friend group. In February, he broke up with his girlfriend because he felt as if they weren’t compatible (his words). They were together exactly 3 months. Keep this in mind. I hope this is all making sense , but to make things even more complicated, R actually had feelings for me and had asked to hangout with me, to which I agreed. The entire hangout felt strictly friendly, even to the point where she was trying to set me up with two of her guy friends. So I shut that down really fast. Anyways, the more we hung out, the more my boyfriend and I seemed to get closer. It was all very friendly at first, but he seemed to come out of his shell a lot. During this time, A stopped coming around because the break up wasn’t mutual and she was getting over her feelings for him. So in turn, I never saw her but the other girls would because they had already been close before the friend group was established. I moved into a new apartment and the night I moved in a couple of friends came over to celebrate, my boyfriend being one of them. From that night on I had them over every night and not everyone would be able to join every time, but if there was one person who was there like clockwork, it was him. He started coming early, we started texting outside the friend group, he would stay later and fall asleep on my couch. The tension between us quickly grew and one night half of the friend group went to the fair and later that night the rest of the friend group joined at my apartment for a small party. I thought everyone would be too drunk to drive home but by the end of the night, everyone had left and it was just my boyfriend left. Nothing happened that night, but the next morning things happened between us. We spent the next 2 days together, and we decided that we would tell the friend group. To make a very long story short, we went over to R’s apartment to talk about it and the only people there were 3 girls from the friend group (not even his ex girlfriend). They were PISSED to say the least. They called me every name in the book you could possibly think of wh*e , sknk, even a combination of the two. Threatened to beat my ass (mind you these girls are about 23-23), threatened me. R was extremely mad, she had thought the feelings she had for me were reciprocated, but the only time she would talk about her feelings with me was when she was drunk and I already struggle with accepting or even knowing my sexuality so I didn’t want to get tangled up in that. At one point, one of the girls had grabbed something off of the coffee table and threw it at me as my boyfriend and I walked out the door. They had viewed what we did as “impulse” and kept claiming that we could’ve “fucked any random person”, meanwhile we were trying to explain it was more than that, but they refused to believe it. Oh on top of that, these girls were absolutely ruthless to me, but excused my boyfriends actions saying that “they understand why he did it” but that i’m the most fucked up person ever for what I did. WE DID THE SAME THING??? They were acting as if I seduced him into bed with me that night lmfao. The ex girlfriend never said anything to me, she did text my boyfriend a paragraph though. Now all those girls are blocked. Some people from the friend group removed me on social media, others didn’t. With all this to say, I have a really bad sense of self and this is one of those situations where I really beat myself up. I have a lot of long time best friends so I know I’m not a terrible friend, I didn’t even really consider myself “close” with these people as we had only hung out for about a month and a half. But still, I tend to care about what other people think of me and a lot of those girls know people that I know. There was even an instance where we all saw each other out at the same rave in different groups and they were harassing me, yelling at me, calling me names, in a public environment. Two of the girls and most of the boys from the friend group still talk to me and interact with me, so sometimes I don’t feel awful about myself. But then there are times where I consider R’s feelings for me or A’s feelings for my boyfriend and I just feel terrible and I cry about it a lot for some reason. My boyfriend and I are still together (4 months) and we’re going really strong and he comforts me about it because he knows I beat myself up about it. My roommate pointed out last night that ever since I lost that group of friends, I’ve just seemed more down than usual. I guess I never noticed it but now that she says it , maybe she’s right.",Sufficient_Sun_4366,https://old.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1lhixm2/a_whole_group_of_people_hate_me_f20_for_dating_my/
confession,I really think something else is wrong with me (self.offmychest),"(TW: depression and mentions of suicidal thoughts) I’m a f19 and I’ve been struggling with my mental health since about middle school when I got diagnosed with depression. During that time, it was manageable and my parents didn’t want me on medication for something so “unrealistic”. I thought nothing of it since it never impacted my grades and I was pretty satisfied with my social standing. It wasn’t until that I started high school to realize that there was something else wrong with me. My freshman year of high school, my grandmother passed away and my home life was not the best because of the stress of virtual classes during Covid (I didn’t have the time to really grieve) . This is when I noticed that my depression was growing; I could constantly miss assignments because my mind wanted to avoid it as much as possible but I wanted to well in school. My mom would yell at me because of my low grades and I’ve tried to explain why but she brushed it off and called me “lazy” since both her and my dad worked all the time. My depression was so bad that I called the suicide hotline and they gave me some advice and sent me to therapy. After awhile, it did work and I got better in school. About my junior year of high school, my childhood dog passed away and the cycle repeated. I tried to explain to my mom why my grades weren’t the best and her response was “ he’s just a dog, it was his time to go”. Of course not the response I was hoping for. She then told me that I belong in a mental hospital because I was crazy and mentally unstable. I was not. I was stressed out and couldn’t even grieve without someone brushing me off and saying “it’s okay” or “ you’re just procrastinating, get your shit together” and my personal favorite: “it’s mind over matter, there’s no such thing as depression”. But when my cousins and other family members speak out about their mental health, your all open arms and then it’s “your mental health matters” and “I think I have depression because of I feel sad all the time” then “ let us know if you’re struggling with your mental health”. Honestly, I think it’s total bullshit because where was this level of support when I was struggling. Now I’m in technical school ( planning to transfer to a 4 year college in a year) to get my prerequisites for my degree. At the same time, my depression is getting worse day by day because of the stress and pent up emotions over the years. I honestly feel so burnt out that it’s currently getting in the way of my classes like I’m being forced to withdraw out of three of the 5 classes that I have. I want to take a year off to just work on myself before I put myself back into school but I still live with my parents. If I told them, they’ll probably lose their shit and I’m scared that they might kick me out. The only choice that I have is to find a full time job but I keep getting rejected from every place. As far as my depression, I think it’s gotten worse and I am going to see a therapist in a couple of days to help with my mental health. TL;DR: My depression has taken over my life and wasn’t able to speak up about it because of my parents.",red_hoodie07,https://old.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1lhiuxa/i_really_think_something_else_is_wrong_with_me/
confession,"Too much change, cant cope (self.offmychest)","I'm not really sure where to start. The last year/year and a half has been changing my life dramatically, both good and bad. And now I feel like I'm hitting a wall in slow motion, and my options doesn't feel particularly good. For context, im 32M with a stable job and good income. I got a nice house and a nice car. I've been together with my girlfriend [30F] for over 10 years now. Looking at the current situation over in the states I'd say I'm doing great actually. A lot has changed in the last year however, and most days now I sit with a knot in my stomach. Last year my mom died of cancer, it wasnt entirely unexpected since she had it for 4 years. But it still went downhill quickly, in a months time she went from functional to dead. I've never had any interest for kids, and my girlfriend knew this. However we got pregnant in april last year and our son was born january this year. I have given the idea of having children a correlation to my mom dying to bring her the joy of grandchildren, but she never made it to see my son. I want to note that I love my son, and I'm under no circumstance feel regret in having him. It was and is very tough knowing my mom never gets to meet my son, but thats just the way it is. The winter/spring continues without much trouble, but closing in on the summer there's changes happening in people around me, in myself and how the relationships are. My girlfriend told me she wasn't interested in physical contact anymore, saying that she got enough from our son and she absolutely wanted zero sex due to needing surgery after the birth. I respect that and do my best to avoid that. Lately we had a discussion where she said she has been thinking about leaving me. Long story short she said I wasn't helping her, or being with her. I might have pulled away too far, and forgotten to help with our son and help with our relationship. But I also feel I was getting rejected for coming closer, and corrected for doing things 'wrong' with our son. It feels like a bad excuse but we've had a great relationship for 10 years and now I feel we're on two sides of the bed. Both physically and emotionally. After the death of my mom, I tried my best to spend time with my dad. He told me it was lonely. Recently he went to Thailand on a 'vacation'. Long story short he had been hiding and lying that he was meeting someone through an app. This feels very weird so close after the death of mom, but I wouldn't mind it as much if it was someone from our country. (Nothing wrong with their etnicity, I find it weird because of language barriers and the distance). After telling him how I feel about that, I also feel rejected and distanced in my relationship with my dad. I feel everyone talks to me differently and behaves differently towards me, and I can't help but think that I'm the common denominator. I'm not really sure where to go from here, I assume therapy is one route.",CHanyy,https://old.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1lhifyp/too_much_change_cant_cope/
confession,How do I ask for physical affection from my friends without coming off as a “where my hug at” creep? (self.offmychest),"Hi ! Im Rubixirë (17m), and I hope you are doing extremely well, Im living in a country where men are supposed to supress emotions, and to show virility by avoiding soft touch, I guess ????? (btw excuse my english), so anyways, the only form of ''good'' touch is the viking hug (strong pats when hugging), and for health reasons I am prohibited to get into any though physical actions, (and yes even pats), So In a nutshell, im very fragile. Last Day i was roaming around the city when i saw my long-time no see cousin who HUGGED me, and i was ashamed but i cried in his shoulders, he was intriged, and he told me if i was fine, i responded that i was okay, and it was just that i missed u sm, that was my last hug and it was from early/mid 2024. I feel so touch starved that anyone could tell i needed touch, but i felt like iit was an irrational feeling since ppl were dying in wars and genocides, but i really would like one, it would solve alot of my problems, So, How do I ask for physical affection from my (few) friends without coming off as a “where my hug at” creep?",OkActivity1257,https://old.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1lhidq5/how_do_i_ask_for_physical_affection_from_my/
confession,Abusive boyfriend (self.offmychest),Hey 22 m and my sister and her boyfriend had a physical fight. he hit her and she still feeling the slaps after a couple of days and when all this happened she called the cops. when he was in jail she called hime a piece of shit and a whole bunch of other things but now he's out and now my sister is like I think I can help him and changing up now and even letting him borrow her car to sleep in. I left for a while and told her I was crashing in a friend's place after some things came up I had to go back. Now I just saw them on the couch together her crying on top of him and this guy is like a tall black male I'm a skinny person I wouldn't be able to take him on my best day. Now I told her before if I see him I would leave and go back home to a different state. Now I don't know if i should do it I mostly came to help with kids and moral support. But I feel if I leave she will feel like she's alone help I'm not sure what the correct or more rational thing to do. Im also thinking of talking to both of them we're all in 20s and I also want her to make her own decisions it's her life but I'm not sure if I should leave or stay and support her decision even if I'm a person of my word I would really appreciate any advice,Emergency_Duck7332,https://old.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1lhiary/abusive_boyfriend/
confession,I've been really rude to my female friend and I couldn't forgive myself (self.offmychest),"A few weeks ago, I noticed that my female friend was being a little distant from me. She would avoid having long conversations and would make excuses whenever I wanted to meet her. However, she didn’t have any problem talking and laughing with another guy who is a mutual friend of ours. I’d like to add that she doesn’t have a crush on him — they’re just good friends. Seeing them together made me feel frustrated, and I started to assume that she was being partial to him. I decided to talk to her, but when I approached her, she again seemed to avoid talking to me. I yelled at her for that, and she told me not to disturb her again. I was so hurt and let my anger cloud my judgment. The next day, she approached me, trying to fix things, but I pushed her away and replied to her rudely. I was guilt-stricken after that and apologised to her two days later. She said, “No worries, what happened had happened,” but I knew she was really hurt. After that, we barely talked and she seemed to avoid eye contact with me. It has been three weeks since this happened, and I still can’t forgive myself. She is a really sweet person and I should have tried to see things from her perspective. The dynamic between us has changed, and I really want to apologise to her again. I want things to go back to normal between us.",Pristine-Band5800,https://old.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1lhi72q/ive_been_really_rude_to_my_female_friend_and_i/

confession,I found my friend’s cat dead //TRIGGER WARNING ⚠️ ANIMAL HARM (self.offmychest),"I’m at my buddy’s house tonight and we’re all enjoying beers together having a good time. They have four dogs (one senior, one two year old and two puppies) and two cats (7 years old). When they got the puppies the cats were absolutely furious and migrated to the basement. Knowing they don’t want to be bothered, they put two gates up blocking the kitchen and the stairway to the basement. I know the puppies have broken out and gone downstairs before to antagonized the cats but I never thought it would get this bad. We all decide to go to bed and as they go to their room I make my way to the basement where I normally sleep when I stay the night. At the bottom of the stairs I notice one of the cats laying mext to a basket they keep down their. I thought to myself, “that’s odd, she’s usually on the cat tower?” So I poke my foot out to nudge her and that’s when I realize the horror to its full extent. She was still, had a hole in her and her guts were hanging out. It looked just like out of a movie or horror game I play. I immediately ran upstairs in agony and had to be the one to tell them what had happened. We buried her tonight. I can’t even watch movies if the pet dies, and now I don’t know how I’m even gonna be able to sleep. I’m horrified but I’m blocked in the driveway and I’m stuck here. I always sleep with a TV on to distract myself anyway but the only unoccupied room is in the basement where it happened. I want to take my anxiety medication to feel better but that’s in the basement too.

confession,Boyfriend has no idea I’m secretly saving up money for him.. (self.offmychest),"My boyfriend has no idea that I am saving his own money for him. Before anyone judges- we are fairly young , I am 21F and he is 20M. We’ve been living together for over a year and been together much longer. We have been through so much together- including financial hardship. He has been having a tough time recently especially after losing hours at work and having to pursue a second job- while we are both full time students. Our savings is low and we have a hard time with our spending and saving up our money from work. Because I make a little more than he does at work, I have been fronting a lot of bills and outings so we could continue to live as close to a normal life as we can with our friends and be somewhat comfortable, when we are usually 50/50. Every now and then I will ask him for $10-20, to pay me back for groceries, eating out- etc; even though I am well okay covering bills to see him smile. Even though times are tough, he will always make an effort to send me what little he has to pay back what he can. Little does he know- when he pays me that money I put it into a secret savings for him that he has no idea about, and plan on giving it all back to him one day. It might sound silly but we truly do have a hard time with our spending and saving. I am writing this here because it’s so hard to keep it a secret from him every time he gives me the little bit that he has, knowing that he really isn’t in a spot to give but is doing it out of love for me. I cannot wait to give it back to him when the amount is high so we can finally get out of the financial rut we have been in for so long.

confession,Friend Drama. Help please. (self.offmychest),"I tried my best to fix something that was broken. And it worked for the most part. Except one person went back on their apology and defended someone else who I see as indefensible. They are defending a pedophile. Someone who took advantage of kids with no consequences. I have all the evidence to expose them. But even with that, it’s possible that people don’t care. That they choose to stay friends with those people I can no longer trust. Which means I can no longer trust the people that are connected to those people. It’s a vicious cycle. And in all of this I’m realizing once again that I’d much rather be alone with friends who are uninvolved with the drama. I fucked up. I need to undo what I did. I don’t want to continue with the expose video because I don’t want to involve any more people. What can I do? Should I try to tell my friends we should finish the video and just stop there and just keep it just in case? What if they don’t like that idea?

confession,idk how to feel abt this (self.offmychest),"hi, i have this ex, we broke up around three months ago and here i am finally confirming my suspicion that he had a side chick while we were together. this suspicious of mine started a year ago. he had a new workmate that he got close to. the worknate was in an abusive relationship and my ex helped her get out of it. of course i didnt think much about it cause we gotta help the girl out. for months on end, she would always be there supporting my ex, again didnt think much about it cause we love a supportive friend. after sometime my gut was telling me that something is up, that he's getting distant from me. later on i would find out that they're eating out together and i didnt know. i set that aside and brushed it off. i broke up with him three months ago because we werent growing anymore and because what we want for the future isnt aligned anymore. i thought itll be a clean break and all but i guess i was wrong. a few weeks later, his grandma died and i was paying my respects by watching the online remembrance mass (i really loved and cherish his grandma). he doesnt know this cause i really didnt want any contact. okay moving on. i saw them together and their body language was telling me that something is up. my gut tells me that they've been together for a certain amount of time. fast forward to today, my speculations has been proven true. his new gf came up as people i may know and the pfp, a picture of them. i wont lie, im happy that he looks happy because of all the things i know about him. what hurts is that he found comfort in another woman's arms while i was in a different place pursuing my dreams. i guess, it wouldve been better if he just told me that he found another rather than me finding it out this way :((",Equivalent_Storm3389,https://old.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1lhhujs/idk_how_to_feel_abt_this/

confession,I hit my husband last night and it wasn’t the first time (self.offmychest),"Let me preface this by first saying I do not condone physical violence of any nature. I (28f) have been struggling with rage towards my husband (29m). Actually I’ve been struggling with anger control my whole life if I’m truthfully honest. I grew up with an abusive dad and after years of therapy, antidepressants, and figuring out how I have been affected by this I am no closer to gaining control over my demons. My trust was broken on very early in my marriage, there were accounts of infidelity but what was worse was the way I had been dismissed. I spent my first year of marriage practically crying the whole time. We’ve known each other since high school, and we were best friends before ever pursuing a relationship. We eventually worked through it, or thats what I believed… The broken trust still haunts me, the lies I was fed, the way my feelings were dismissed until he had the capacity to hold them. It eats away at a person, especially someone already so fragile like me. Anyway we try to move on but another issue started to come to play. His binge drinking habits. It’s typical culture in our town to go to the club then afters where you snort all the cocaine u can before the sun rises and even way past that too. I too have been privy to joining my husband on this sessions but eventually I realised the meaningless behind it and felt shame for the waste of money and health. My husband agrees too although it has a much stronger hold over him, only recently has he admitted it’s an addiction. Anyway I am just giving you the lay of the land before I tell you about our next issue. I can be physically violent to myself and to him. It is incredibly dangerous I know. It happened yesterday after I promised the last time (after the police were called) that I would never do it again. But I fucking snapped yesterday, over something so trivial too, I mistakenly assumed when he said “I’m gonna see what my friend is up to” (one of his go-to drinking buddies) that he was going on another binge. He got annoyed, I got crushed that my feelings (more specifically fears) were once again being dismissed and the more he spoke over me and didn’t listen the more it started to burn in my chest. We were in the car home as this was happening and I flung an ice cream at him out of sheer frustration and when he said I should apologise for that it made me even more mad so I threw a can which bounced off the windshield and cracked it🥴 It got worse when we got home. I was uncontrollably sobbing in a shame spiral and he did try to support and soothe me but he eventually pivoted to adding onto the shame and telling me none of this was his fault. Eventually that makes me snap again so I run to the kitchen to self harm and he wrestled to get the knife off me, I bit him when he twisted my arm back. He then said he’s done, started putting his shoes on and that’s when I attacked him, I slapped him several times across the face, I screamed profanities at him. The more he tried to leave the more frantic I became. He told me it was over, he’s saying at his mums and I’ll be home alone. My mums tried to support me, slept over last night, she even spoke to his mum but all his mum could see was the danger I put his son in and the state she had to pick him up in. So I’m sure they’re all gathered round the dinner table discussing what a troubled individual I am. I understand that what I did was completely unacceptable, I wish more than anything I didn’t snap and cross the line into abusive territory. I feel sick that I did it but even more sick that it wasn’t the first time 😖 TL;DR: I’ve struggled with anger my whole life due to childhood abuse. My marriage has been rocky, with past infidelity and my husband’s substance issues contributing to a breakdown in trust. Yesterday, I became physically violent during an argument, despite promising it would never happen again. I feel immense shame, I know what I did was abusive, and I don’t know how to come back from this.",heram24,https://old.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1lhhqxd/i_hit_my_husband_last_night_and_it_wasnt_the/
confession,Venting.. (self.offmychest),"It's been a few days since I actually felt like I'm living. I've merely been existing. I'm not eating much, have no interest in doing anything, and I keep questioning my life choices and my entire existence. I don't know how long I'm going to feel like this. Anxiety hits me randomly throughout the day. This new wave started after I failed an exam that I had been preparing for over the past few years. On top of that, I haven’t been able to find a job that truly aligns with what I want to do, even though I’ve been trying. When I think of my family, all I see is how much I’ve fallen short of their expectations. Whether or not they say it out loud, I feel like I’ve let them down. I feel like a disappointment, like I’m just taking up space without adding anything meaningful to the lives of those around me.",fly-faraway,https://old.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1lhhprf/venting/
confession,I sometimes wish my family were bed (self.offmychest),"I am part of a big family where almost everyone is very close to each other, which I used to not mind, but nowadays it feels suffocating. Some days I feel like my family cares for me, supports me, and loves me. Everything they say and do is always for my good. If I feel like they did me wrong, it is either an accident or just me overthinking. Other days I feel like I don't have a choice. As if I am expected to do what they think is best for me, like my feelings, dreams, and desires to them is just a phase they expect me to outgrow at any moment. I hate how normal it has become to forgive them even if they abandoned me in my time of need, then told people years later I never went to them for help. I hate how normal it has become to expect a lot from myself but nothing from them, even if it's just telling me about my dad's illness. I started to plan my life, to hopefully move and run away from everything. But I know I can't escape them, even if I do that, I can't cut them out of my life, I just can't.. I am so weak to do this, I love some of them too much, and cutting the others will make those who matter disappointed. That's why sometimes I wish my family were bad, so I don't feel guilty when I leave.",BlackishPurpleSheep,https://old.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1lhhong/i_sometimes_wish_my_family_were_bed/
confession,i miss my teacher (self.offmychest),"i just really miss my teacher. i recently graduated high school and there was one teacher who, out of the 20-something teachers i had ever had, genuinely cared and wanted to see me succeed. first period chemistry sucked but i was one of the first people who came in. sometimes, she’d ask if i was okay, to which i would lie and say that i was fine. deep down i knew i was suffering, but over time, i grew more fond of her class and how she’d actually cared for me. i opened up to her about my depression. she kept it between us, saying where my problems lie (burden of generating income, unhealthy obsession with academic validation) and honestly, she lifted me out of a deep hole i dug myself in. she was really smart. she graduated with a masters in chemistry, summa cum laude, and told me to push myself. the next year, i took ap chemistry. i would be excited to come to her class after school with questions, to which i got explanations and answers to everything i was confused on. maybe i didn’t get a 5, but she probably would still be proud anyway. i got accepted into chemical engineering at a prestigious institute. like, ranked in the top 5 for chemical engineering. i only did it because her class made me like chemistry. but what’s so unfortunate is that she isn’t there to be proud of me. and it sucks, it really does. i miss her so much because what i thought was the bare minimum was actually something she was proud of. it was like, “im proud of you for trying your best” and it touched me. and now i stand here crying and typing because she will never know of my proudest accomplishments. i just hope she’s doing okay. i really really miss her.",ilovestevenide,https://old.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1lhhnfg/i_miss_my_teacher/
confession,Ex Girlfriend chose a bum over me (self.offmychest),"So for context, me and my ex gf have been dating for a little over 5 years. She was everything I’ve ever wanted. Never did me wrong, I trusted her. Me, on the other hand, I was a douchebag to her now that I think about it lol. Just tonight she ended things with me because she likes someone else. Mind you, he has nothing going for him. Dropout, no ambition, no job. I wouldn’t say I’m perfect because I do have a record (felony for perjury). And I’ve done her dirty several times, I’m truly sorry about what I did. She’s almost done with school for MRI Tech. So the fact that she would go for someone like that makes me scratch my head. She says that “he understands me”. I guess, whatever. I’ll just be here hustling, I do want you back but if you choose him over me, fuck it. I really saw a future with you. Had everything planned out. I hope he is everything you ever wanted. I don’t know why I wrote this, I’m just depressed and miss her dearly.

confession,I'm becoming a closed-off person. (self.offmychest),"I'm 30. Up to now, I've always been sociable. I didn't always find close friends, but I always wanted to and made efforts. I enjoyed being part of a group. I was happy to be invited to anything and I was pretty much always down to tag along. I liked being asked to help and I was always down to be there for a friend when needed. During a lot of my 20s, I was part of a close friend group that was always there for each other despite our flaws or disagreements, and that was important to me. That also translated into my work. I always wanted to be helpful and do whatever I could for my supervisors. So my supervisors usually loved me. I pursued a career path where I'm helping members of the public, often in a stressful situation. Everything changed this last year. I was in a relationship that took a lot out of me. My ex grew up in an abusive home and she was used to a much higher level of conflict. I think she had anxiety about certain things but she couldn't identify it as anxiety, so she'd take it out on me. She'd demand that I do certain things and get really angry if I didn't. I tried to push back sometimes but that didn't go well. So then I tried to give her what she was asking for and soothe her fears. I felt like I tried and tried and tried. It was such a burden, everything I was doing for her, and still she was yelling at me. Sometimes she would get pretty intense. Eventually, I broke up with her. After the breakup, she was going through a crisis, she was saying that it was medical issues but it seemed like it was also mental health related. She came up with reasons why I was the only one who could help. I felt bad because she was clearly really struggling. I told her that she had to stop coming to me. She started preparing to attempt suicide and I stopped her. She went to go stay with her family, attempted suicide four times, and got institutionalized. She's now out and working on recovering. She still doesn't think she has mental health issues though. I feel like the whole thing has made me a more closed-off person. I don't want to help others anymore. I don't know why, but I don't get that feeling of warmth and satisfaction anymore. I just feel stressed and anxious. I have to actively try to tap into empathy that used to happen naturally. Maybe deep down I partially blame myself for my ex's crisis, like I let her depend on me too much. A friend said something to that effect during the worst of it. I don't actively blame myself anymore but maybe it's still there deep down. I don't really want to be close to people. I'll still enjoy time with my close friends, but I feel like I need a lot more alone time and it's hard for me to feel that warm, close feeling. I haven't really made any new bonds. I have one friend who can be a bit needy like my ex and I sometimes struggle with that a lot. She needed help with something recently and I had such a bad gut reaction, even though the thing was totally real and legitimate. I wish I could be who I was before. I think I was a better person. I don't want this whole thing to change me. I don't know what to do. Maybe if I meet someone new, that would help. But I don't know how to be open to that.",82sundat,https://old.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1lhhi1f/im_becoming_a_closedoff_person/
confession,Parasite (self.offmychest),"If you ever ask me what my favorite movie is, I’d say Parasite without hesitation. I love it for so many reasons—the phenomenal acting, the complex plot, the brilliant cinematography. But behind that, the film means something to me on a much deeper and more personal level. There’s a certain scene in the movie that has stayed with me since the time I finished watching. It was the night of the heavy rain. For the rich, it was a peaceful and relaxing evening. They even mentioned how well they slept because of the storm. But for the poor, it was a night of suffering. Their home was flooded, their belongings were ruined, and everything they had worked so hard to protect was washed away. They had nowhere to go except a crowded evacuation center. And in their rush, they had no choice but to wear whatever leftover clothes they could find in the temporary shelter. What broke me was when the rich asked where the “bad smell” was coming from, completely unaware it was from the people who just lost everything. At that time, the unfairness hit me so hard that I felt like I was really one of them. Why do the ones who hurt the deepest always go unnoticed? It seems like the world only looks away when it's the poor who are crying for help. That part impacted me severely, it brought back a memory I had burried deep in my mind long ago. It was during a stormy night as well—our house was flooding, thunder shook the roof, and I could feel the fear creeping into my bones. I was still so young, but old enough to think that,""What if we weren’t poor? What if we had been born into a life full of comfort instead? Would everything be different? Would I still feel like this?"" At the time, I didn’t understand why my parents chose to have me and my older brother when they were clearly struggling financially. I know they loved each other, and they loved us, but part of me resented them for bringing us into a world where we had so little. That storm didn’t just flood our home; it flooded me with questions and emotions I didn’t yet know how to express. That night, I made a quiet promise to myself, that when it’s my turn to build a family, I will do everything in my power to give my future children a safe, secure, and loving home. I’ll work hard not just for comfort, but for peace. So that they never have to ask the same questions I did with myself on that stormy night.",azechives,https://old.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1lhhht7/parasite/

confession,Struggling with thoughts of death as I’m getting older. (self.offmychest),"Over the past year I've found myself anxious at night thinking about death. I'm about to turn 40 and I can't help but every night sleep saddened at though of dying. It's mostly focused around a few areas: 1) My parents. While they are still in their 60s they are starting to look more frail and develop minor conditions. I just can't help but get very sad at thought of a world without them. At some point I'll never be able to call my mom or dad again and it's just me and my own family and siblings in this world. 2) Me. I'm overweight and have neglected by body and been lucky enough to never have problems. But now the thought of having done permanent damage and cutting my life short creeps in. I'm scared of suddenly dying but more often than not I think about how I will be alone in my final moments and how scary that is. Even with loved ones, eventually they all have their life's and it'll be just me having to deal with death alone in a hospital and who knows how it will be. 3) One life and no regrets. I married someone who had a child and we've raised her together but they couldn't have anymore children. It hasnt really been a problem but now at 39 I'm wondering if maybe I should've had my own children. She's going to college this year and I still want to experience being a parent again and I'll never have my own kids, and never experience that and it saddens me. I struggle because I love my partner and I'm happy with her but the thought of only having one life and not having any biological children has me sad as I think about this being it for me. The thoughts are becoming more invasive, always at night as I sit here trying to sleep and they cause pressure on my chest and anxiety. Yet during the day I go about my day without a thought or care in the world. Any words of wisdom or advice from anyone who's dealt with same would be much appreciated.",Typingtext,https://old.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1lhh4ea/struggling_with_thoughts_of_death_as_im_getting/
confession,I’m exhausted from pretending everything is fine when it’s not (self.offmychest),I’m so tired of putting on this happy face for everyone around me. People always say I’m strong and that I handle things so well but the truth is I’m struggling a lot more than anyone realizes. Every day feels like I’m carrying a weight that no one else can see. I smile and laugh with my friends but inside I’m battling anxiety and doubt that never seem to go away. I feel alone even in a crowded room because no one really knows what’s going on behind the scenes. Sometimes I just want to scream or break down but I hold it all in because I don’t want to be a burden. I don’t know when the last time I truly felt peaceful was. I’m scared of what happens if I let this all out or if I stop pretending for just one second. But I also know I can’t keep going like this forever. I’m not even sure why I’m writing this here but maybe just admitting it to strangers will help me feel less invisible.

confession,Scared for my life and idk what to do about it (self.offmychest),"First time posting and idk how this exactly works, but I’d like to ask to please keep all political comments to yourselves cuz this has nothing to do with that. Here goes, I live in a country that’s currently at war, y’all can probably guess which country. For the past few weeks I’ve been dealing with a lot on a personal level and then this whole situation started and I can feel myself slipping away slowly, I don’t feel like I have a grasp of who I am anymore. This morning I woke up around 7:20am to get ready for work (i work from home). At 7:30 we got a warning of missile fire so I walked as fast as I could to the nearest shelter which isn’t that close to my apt. I usually smoke a cig outside the shelter until we hear the sirens but this time there were no sirens. I was outside the shelter when we heard the scariest sound I’ve ever heard in my life. A missile hit the ground somewhere around us. It was so close you could literally feel the change in air pressure around the whole area. That scared the living hell out of me to state the obvious. I feel like everything that’s been happening neutralized me. I can’t work, I can’t sleep, I can’t eat, I can’t even think. This has been absolute hell for me and I’m always scared and worried for everyone I love. I don’t even know why I’m writing this post.

confession,i’m crazy about my friend but can’t do anything about it ): (self.offmychest),"i’ve known this guy for a little while now. we have some mutual friends, and my goodness i am crazy about him. when i was with my ex, i never paid much attention to him obviously, but since im single now he’s all that i can think about, which makes sense considering my ex was oddly jealous of him before i even felt this way. we talk a lot, we have a lot of the same interests, passions, goals and humor. we even want the same career when we’re older and to follow the same journey there. to add to that, he’s also very tall, handsome, and absolutely hilarious, we tease each other like crazy when we’re together and we have a lot of good conversations. i absolutely love being near him as well, it makes me feel comfortable. he was even there for me when my ex left me, helping me get over it which was very sweet. there are some problems to this though. one, i’m absolutely not his type, and though i actually used to be i wouldn’t want to change myself i am happy with who i am now. i’m also moving 12 hours away for school and he’s staying here in our hometown. he also somehow knows a lot about what girls like and details about nails and makeup. i guess this is because most of his friends are girls, but he’s only ever expressed interest in one who now has a partner. when i asked about how he knows so much, he said so he can know what his potential girlfriend likes, which kinda hurt but whatever. as much as i really like him, i can’t say anything about it to him or our friends because im too afraid to risk what we already have.",Traditional_Appeal_6,https://old.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1lhgxr8/im_crazy_about_my_friend_but_cant_do_anything/
confession,I don’t think I’m the “nice girl” everyone thinks I am (self.offmychest),Everyone around me always says how sweet and caring I am. My friends tell me I have the biggest heart my coworkers say I’m the “positive energy” in the room and even strangers have said I seem so warm. And the thing is I try to be that person. I want to be kind I want to be someone people can lean on. But lately I’ve been catching myself thinking things I’m not proud of. I get jealous over little things. I get annoyed at people I love for no real reason. Sometimes I smile while my brain is screaming just shut up already. And the worst part is I fake it. I nod I say the right words but in my head I’m just checked out or quietly judging or being bitter. I hate that version of me. I don’t talk about this because I know people would be shocked. Like it would break the image they have of me. But pretending to be the “nice girl” all the time is exhausting. I feel like I’m living on autopilot playing a role that doesn’t even feel real half the time. And maybe this is just burnout or stress but part of me wonders if I’m just not as good of a person as I thought. Anyway I don’t really expect advice or anything.

confession,I feel like I'm the disappointment child. (self.offmychest),"Hi, I'm 23 and would rather not disclose my gender. Before I begin, I'm sorry about my grammar or english ahead of time. I was very emotional upon writing this and needed a place to vent. I recently just broke up with my ex, who I'm taking a break from to grow, and hopefully come back to a better place with them. Before I lefty apartment, I need to say it was definitely a mess. We were both depressed, and neither of us felt like we could clean. This is important cause, my parents came to help pack, they saw the mess it was in, and now I can't stop hearing about it from my mom. She was upset that packing wasn't done, that the apartment was a mess, and app these different things and it just all feels like it's my fault. I come home, and see my sister, she's the creative one, super crafty, getting A's and B's, Sophomore in high school, and super tidy. Complete opposite of me, except for not being able to get A's and B's. She's the kid my parents talk proudly of, while my mom bashes on me to friends at work. My dad has little or nothing to say due to a brain injury he endured about 2-3 years ago, and he isn't the same man he was. Yes, my mom is upset she's gotta be the main provider now for everything, but it often feels like she wants a perfect little world, with a perfect little home, and a perfect little family. I just often feel like I don't fit into that, with how much these arguments happen.

confession,I think I’m falling out of love and I feel horrible about it (self.offmychest),I don’t even know where to start with this because it makes me feel like the bad guy just for thinking it. I’ve been with my boyfriend for almost three years. He’s kind he’s loyal he’s never done anything to hurt me and honestly I used to see a whole future with him. But lately I’ve just felt... disconnected. Like I’m going through the motions more than actually feeling anything. We hang out we do the usual things couples do and I still care about him deeply but it’s not the same. The butterflies are gone and I’m not sure they’re coming back. Every time he talks about our future together I get this weird tight feeling in my chest like I’m trapped and I hate that. I keep wondering if I’m just going through a phase or if this is really me realizing we aren’t meant to last forever. And what scares me the most is that if I do leave I’m walking away from someone who’s done nothing wrong. He doesn’t deserve to be hurt like that. But at the same time it feels unfair to stay if my heart’s not fully in it anymore. I haven’t told anyone this not even my friends because I don’t want to be judged or pushed either way. I guess I just needed to get it out of my system. I don’t want to make the wrong choice but I also don’t want to keep pretending like everything’s fine. Thanks for reading if you got this far.

confession,My mom just blew her life up by drunk driving. (self.offmychest),"I don't even know how I feel right now. Today started off so good. It was my daughter's birthday party and I spent weeks planning every detail. It was unicorn themed and they had cupcakes with ice cream cones on top so they could decorate their own ""unicorn horn"", we did glittery drink bombs, a fruit rainbow, I even practiced face painting all week so I could paint the faces of her friends. Everything was perfect. My mom and 3 youngest siblings came and despite the rough childhood I had she seemed to be doing so much better this past year. We have been talking so much and I have been really enjoying my time with her. She gave my daughter a beautiful baby doll to play with and my daughter loved it. It was time to pack up and go and she had some things to drop off at my house. She said she would follow us to our home. She said she was going to follow us and we noticed her driving strangely. Suddenly she turned down a wrong road and we called her. She was somewhat responding but barely with one word answers and not making much sense. Suddenly my siblings started screaming, begging her to turn around, then to stop. They said she hit a car and were panicking. I froze and just listened, trying to decypher if this was real or just kids exaggerating. I told my husband what was happening and he jumped back in the car to look for them. He called them and when he heard the kids crying and screaming he called 911. She jumped on the freeway, going in the opposite direction of her house. The kids say they were screaming at her to stop, throwing shoes at her, cussing at her, anything to get her attention and she never responded. She eventually pulled off the freeway before passing out. When the police got there they found an opened bottle of rum. My husband was able to pick up the kids and bring them back to our home. I have been messaging my step dad who is on a trip in the middle of nowhere with only a sattilite phone to communicate. My mom was so intoxicated that they had to intubate her at the hospital. I feel so conflicted because I feel like I was just starting to open my heart to her. I saw her phone home screen and it is a picture of my two girls and I just want to cry. I thought she was doing much better, for the first time in forever I could see her trying. She has woken me up with a phone call every morning for 3 weeks because she wants to read scriptures with me and talk to me. I am looking at this cute doll she got my daughter for her birthday and my heart just breaks. She is likely going to lose custody of the kids and works in a field where she will likely lose her job that she has been putting lots of overtime into. I talked to my sister, and I didn't know that she has been cleaning my mom's house for her, there was moldy food in the kitchen, clothes all over. My heart is breaking because she must have been struggling all alone. But I am also so freaking mad at her. How could she put my siblings in danger like that! How could she put others in danger like that! How could she do all of this at my daughter's birthday party! I feel so hurt and conflicted. I don't know how to make sense of any of this but can't even process fully with my siblings here.",lovinfluff,https://old.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1lhgu8j/my_mom_just_blew_her_life_up_by_drunk_driving/
confession,Something just clicked (self.offmychest),"I’m high as I’m typing this. Here I am going on the Internet, talking to strangers and telling them a revelation about myself that I've had. I went out with a friend and we had the most amazing conversation about life, relationships, friendships, and I really never get high because I think too deeply since I'm already a deep thinker sober and I've been single for a long time almost 10 years and I've only had Situationships and I'm starting to reflect on why I choose emotionally unavailable people and I think it's because I fear intimacy. I'm scared that I'm not gonna be who I would like to be in a relationship. I think that I fear what I'll be mirrored back. I wanna be a great girlfriend a great wife and a great mom one day and it scares me that I may not because of my past experiences or who or how I acted in past relationships of being not emotionally aware of my inner world and I know that I've grown and I need to forgive myself for my past, it wasn't terribly bad, but I really struggled in a lot of ways emotionally and maturely. I think I'm just scared. I'm scared to go the depths with someone although my friendships are deep and I know how to navigate conflict pretty well and I know myself, but I'm still learning about myself, but I feel like being in a romantic relationship. I'll really learn even more about myself and that scares me even though I know that I'm healthy in a lot of ways it's just I think also because I come from a really traumatic childhood. I'm just scared to re-create that with someone else and yeah, I think overall intimacy scares me and if I continue to go after people who are not available emotionally, then I don't have to face my fear.",Unique-Evidence-4355,https://old.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1lhgt4w/something_just_clicked/
ShameGuilt,"I regret harassing my ex, how do I move past it now? I don’t want to let it define the rest of my life! (self.ShameGuilt)","For some context, my ex was not the best to me, she would lie & cheat & would receive nudes from other people while we were dating. One day I broke up with her & the same night I broke up with her I went & I slept with someone else. The next day my ex and I met up and we tried to reconnect but I felt guilty about what I did the night before when I broke up with her so I told her straight up I slept with someone else. So then she proceeded to tell me she knows people who can kill me & make it seem like an accident. I was sick to my stomach when she said that. We broke up and I held on to the resentment from everything that happened in our relationship. I found out years after our relationship she is engaged & seems happy. To be honest I felt angry about this because how can someone so nasty still get good things in life? So I went online created a fake account and I wrote some mean nasty comments about my ex on one of their engagement posts. My ex figured out it was me on the other end of those nasty comments. I genuinely hope she treats this person better! I just still feel resentful but I don’t want to let this define me as a person. Any critical feedback would be appreciated. Trust me, I know I need to learn to move on but in the heat of the moment I let my emotions overpower me & I acted out of anger & resentment & I posted the nasty comments on her engagement post. How might this affect my future relationships if they ask me about my past relationship history?

ShameGuilt,"Feeling guilty about this, and wanting advice. (self.ShameGuilt)","Because of a previous relationship scarred me so bad, from being cheated on so many times, mentally abused, traumatized, depression. Leaving them was the best thing ever. Found myself a loving relationship many months after... but a friend of the past was struggling through difficulties, and I wanted to be kind, but was too soft-hearted, one thing led to another, and was trying to help someone, and i ended up stuck in a feeling guilty if i dont help someone, and they used my kindness, and was caught saying nice things that ended up flirting with them, and sending them one picture. My current bf found out, he was super upset with me, and struggled to not break up with me, but i gave him the choice anyways. i sound like a judgey asshole with myself, but i really love my current bf, and i feel ashamed and guilty over what I did. Now he gave me anther chance, and now I'm struggling to cope with it. I feel bad whenever I make a new friend, and even more scared if they happen to be a guy. I'm working really hard so I can make up for what I did, but I know I never will. I want to stop feeling guilty, but I know I can't. I am in therapy, but the guilt is starting to cripple my mental health, and I have looked at death as an option for me, but I feel like that way is too painless for someone who committed a crime like this. Thanks for listening. Any advice on what I can do? TLDR; Got cheated on in the past, scared and traumatized, I cheated on my current bf trying to help another person, he gave me another chance with trust hanging, and I'm constantly reminding myself about my guilt, and it's degrading my mental health. Thinking that death might be an option. Scared that making new friends is scary, because they are ""male"" and scared the situation will repeat, and my bf will be angry at me for doing so.

I was extremely pissed off already by two younger stupid shits that found it funny to push me again and again and then my little sister was extremely mean to my other little sister and it pissed me off even more . I was cold , not showing a smile to anyone , not joking , not anything . Thereafter , my dad came back home and immediately started to scream against my mother as she did the same . So , whenever I hear screams , I set up my earphones to prevent myself from crying because of my stupid sensitivity . And , my big sister , as sensitive as me , came in my room and asked me if I wanted to watch the reels I sent her with her , but I said NO . I looked at her in the eyes , seeing her laughing a bit while her eyes were turning red , like if blood was propagating in her eyes before that she walked away quickly. I think I should , like , right now when I write it , go to see her , apology . But I feel so bad . And what could I say ? She thinks I'm turning depressive , which is true but I never admitted it to her . She texted me ""do you hate me ? :("" and I didn't find anything better than writing ""no"" . Then she texted ""You are sad"" and I wrote ""No . You are"" .

ShameGuilt,"i'm a terrible person, and i hate myself more than anyone else. i don't know what to do. (self.ShameGuilt)","i have for a few years had a problem with hating myself. not because of me as a person, but mostly because of my actions. i have the most amazing friends and family and people in my life in general, my life could've been almost perfect if it wasn't because i was such an asshole. almost everything i think about is how i deserve nothing and is an awful human being. i act like a combination of an 11 year old boy who thinks he is cool, a little kid and a monkey. i act on my impulsive thoughts and end up embarrasing myself and hurting others and i make everyone uncomfortable all the time. i wish i could fly away from my body, get a new personality and a new soul and start over again. i can't stand who i am, my actions, my thoughts, my way of being, my anything, and it's so hard to live with. i don't know how to change or move an from the things i've done and i really need help. i'm gonna list a few of the things i've done, so you have an idea of what kinda stuff i'm talking about. - i talked shit about my best friend with another one of my friends. we were talking about stuff like his weight, his family problems, all that kinda stuff you should NOT talk abot. i don't know why and i don't think i realized what i was doing before it was already done. i think i kinda ""woke up"" when the person i was talking with said that we should stop talking shit. i don't know how i could make myself do that, my friend is so amazing, he really didn't deserve that at all. i regret it sm and i've cried so much over it, i just wish i could undo it. even though it's a long time ago, i still can't move on from it. - the same person i was talking trash about, i also have a crush on. i got told that he liked me back and after that, i basicly tried to force my emotions on him. for example, i put my hand on his leg bc he was bounching it and i wanted him to stop, but i think i was just using it as an excuse to put my hand on his leg. i did that several times. i put my lips on the back of his jacket when we were walking on a staircase. he didn't notice it but still, why would i do that? i also told him i was gonna spit in his mouth, (as a joke, but a really stupid one,) told him ""fuck i love you"" (which is both weird and embarrasing), told him ""i'm gonna touch you"", which is probably the worst one of them, (i also said that as a joke, but idk if he knew that) and A LOT of similar dumb shit. he knew i liked him when i said all of those things. - i slapped my friend's ass. he is the opposite gender of me, and he never said it was ok for me to do that. it was meant as a joke, but that's not an excuse. i did it four times. i also said some really weird shit to him almost everyday in a pretty long period of time. i would turn almost every conversation we would have into jokes about that i wanted to suck his dick, fuck him or anything like that, and then i would laugh at my own offensive, unfunny jokes like a fucking seagull. i kinda did the same thing with another one of my friends, and i'm pretty sure i was making the other friend really uncomfortable, and i fucking hate making people uncomfortable, so why did i do it? i just really wish i could undo it, omg. - my friend once said something i thought sounded like a moan, and i repeated what she said, but laid extra weight on the part i thought sounded like a moan. i did that three times. the third time, she told me that she thought it was disgusting and weird, which it 100% also was. i did end up appoligizing. - i slapped my friend in the face for almost no reason. he started crying and i went to the bathroom and did the same thing. - i sometimes joke with serious topics, like ww2, putin, homophobia, racism, fatphobia, etc. the jokes i make aren't even funny, just stupid. - yk the guy everyone is asking to ""oil up"" in his comments? yeah, i did that. but i didn't just say ""oil up"", i said ""oil up daddy😏😫🍆 or something like that. - for a whole year, i faked ocd. someone i thought was cool had it. i had just moved school, and i didn't have many friends at my old school, so i would've done anything to get attention. - every day, i say fucked up and embarrasing shit. i don't know why i do it, i just think i don't know what else to say and end up saying weird stuff. i wish i could stop, or just shut the fuck up for once, but for some reason, i can't. i also make fun of my friends A LOT. they do the same thing with me, and i'm pretty sure they know i'm joking, but what if they don't? i just really hope they know how much i love them. i don't know why they want to be around me, i wouldn't if i were them, but i'm so happy they're in my life, i hope they're aware of that. i'm just not sure if they are. those are just a few examples, i have prbly done worse things, those where just the ones at the top of my head. i don't know how to move on annd be better, my biggest wish is to be a good person.

ShameGuilt,"I get turned on by the wrong things, and I don't know what's wrong with me. (self.ShameGuilt)","Like the title says, for as long as I can remember I've been turned on by the worst thing I can imagine. That thing being the act of forcing oneself on another human. The thing is is that I'm actually firmly against rxpe, and sexual assault, but it's the only thing that turns me on. No, I don't seek out videos of the act being performed, the thought of doing so makes me sick. But I write as a hobby, and when it comes time to..do that, I write about such things, and it turns me on. I feel like a shit person, rightfully, but I don't know where to begin with fixing myself. I believe I've been this way since I was a child, as I explored that side of myself when I was as young as six years old. For context, I was exposed to sex, and sex related things at a very young age. By the age of six, I was being ""molested"" by my older sibling, and as much as it made me uncomfortable, I never told my mother. At the same time, my friend and her brother (all within the same age group) had been trying stuff like that with me. I was always uncomfortable with it, but I never said anything to anyone about how uncomfortable it made me feel. I blame that on the way I was raised. But around that same time I was on the internet, and I came across a video that implied sexual assault. It was a My little Pony animation, and it wasn't very graphic at all, but it still implied that one of the characters was there against their will. As the years went on, I had instances with other kids where they'd want to do things like that, and I always hesitantly agreed. But I'd also found out about porn sites through kids at school, and that was where it became an actual problem. By nine years old, I was actively seeking out videos of SA. I hate even being able to admit to something so despicable. They were movie scenes, so they were fake, but what I was looking for was very real. By the age of twelve, I begun to have a better grasp on things. I hated rapists with a passion. I'd said multiple times that I would dedicate my life to wiping them off the planet. I stopped using porn sites in fear of the fact that those people could have been acting in videos against their will. To end this, I'd just like to clarify that I would never, nor have I ever even thought about forcing myself on another person, but I'm worried that I won't grow out of it. I'm worried that I won't be able to have a normal relationship. I just want to know if there's any way that I can stop myself. Or if there could be something that this stemmed from, so I can identify the problem correctly. I don't even know where to begin, and this post is all over the place. If anyone had the courage to read through this bs, please give me some advice.",Throwwway_17,https://old.reddit.com/r/ShameGuilt/comments/1icpde6/i_get_turned_on_by_the_wrong_things_and_i_dont/

ShameGuilt,Dealing with huge guilt and shame in my 6 year relationship with borderline cheating (self.ShameGuilt),"Okay this is really hard for me... Im in a relationship of more than 5 years now with a wonderful wonderful woman. She is basically my first and hopefully my last. Im pretty much what you could call a loser. And i was raised with an insane ego. And even aside of that i have a giant ego. My upbringing wasnt the easiest. I was the outsider genius kid who already read in kindergarden and looked down on anyone who couldnt understand complex or ""sophisticated"" matters. I grew up basically apart from the normal world. And i never did what i should do but what i wanted. The latter thing made be fail at a lot of societal things. Well like all relationships my gf and me had a rough patch 2 years ago and i basically became unfaithful via chat and pics. I could go on and on how it had to do with me always having felt too superior for ""horny"" stuff and now being overwhelmed by it by my first experience with my gf that was 4 years ago and since she had her own demons to fight she wasnt physically and mentally really available but still what ive done is wrong. She forgave me multiple times. And even tried to work out an open relationship with me that nearly broke her. Now she constantly works and im at home.. and i tried finding friends since a while who could cover my absurd amount of interests but with time i grew frustrated again... and i started trying to get on a primitive level to hopefully at least a connect that way.. I havent really done anything in the meanwhile.. but my guilt and shame for what i am makes me act up... and makes my gf lose her sleep and check my phone.. and tho i dont really.. lets call it mentally cheat anymore i act up.. and well.. my chats arent really nice too.. they are still kind of shameful from time to time.. i just so desperately want to understand what it takes to connect to other humans.. and i want to be worth my gf... shes only away so much because shes overworking herself.. and id be compmetely happy and satisfied if i could just spend time with her.... well.. i want peace of mind.. and that she can be happy again.. i want to lose this guilt",YaBoyMeAgain,https://old.reddit.com/r/ShameGuilt/comments/1fote59/dealing_with_huge_guilt_and_shame_in_my_6_year/
ShameGuilt,"How to grieve, process and come to terms with an already mentally disabled sibling becoming physically disabled. (self.ShameGuilt)","My 16yo brother w Down's Syndrome has had an unidentifiable illness for almost 10 months. He had been hospitalized for 2.5 months due to catatonia but the underlying issue has not been resolved because he is still very sick but stable. Physically still strong and cognitively aware. All bodily functions working. But I'm not gonna go into detail what is wrong, just know he's no where near healed. We have gone through hell as a family. The doctors do not care and have dismissed us. Not putting in any effort to investigate. There is no sense of urgency and we fear permanent damage is done. He's normally lower functioning and relatively non-verbal but is now a shell of his former self. Doesn't leave bed, barely talks. He was an active boy. Played soccer and frisbee. Sang and danced. Jumped on our trampoline and played catch. Now nothing. I don't even remember what life was like with him before this. He's currently physically disabled due to the unknown illness and can't do anything but stay in bed. If permanent damage is done, his life is over. I am overwhelmed with grief. Grieving for my parents. Grieving for myself. He is my whole world and best friend, has been the only one there for me in my darkest moments. I feel helpless. But worst of all, I'm grieving for him. His lost time and his life. He doesn't deserve this. I can barely function because of the grief. I know I have to have hope and bring joy to him in anyway but it's hard.

ShameGuilt,How to grieve while having the shame of being the other women? (self.ShameGuilt),"I am 29F and I got myself into an affair. To provide some insight, my whole life I've been alone. I have friends but never a deep connection, and I've never had a significant other. I am insecure and felt I would never be desired by anyone, and even if someone desired me, I felt nothing and would think to myself that I'm asexual or something. A few years ago, I met a guy with whom I instantly clicked. I found him attractive from the start, but he had a long-term, long-distance relationship, so I didn't want anything from him. As months went by, he showed so much care for me, and I grew to care for him a lot as well. He became such an emotional support, and I never thought someone could understand me and accept my flaws this way. He was my best friend, and I became so dependent on this attachment. I always wondered why he gave so much time to me when he already had a girlfriend. He assured me that she was a very secure person. I felt safe with him and considered him an important person in my life. Somewhere down the line, we messed up and started sexting. When we started this, I thought we would be together. I told myself it was a no-brainer, and these feelings meant we were supposed to be together. He tried to end things with his long-term girlfriend, but she fought hard for him. I soon became miserable and was waiting for him to leave her, as he said he was miserable with her but couldn't let go of her. All while being with me, he made it sound like he was trapped. I asked him finally to leave her, and he never did, so he made his choice. After much anguish, I decided to finally end this affair. It was going nowhere. I assume he got all his feelings back for her that he had lost, and that's probably why he wanted me in the first place. After some time, I talked to him and asked if we could maintain our friendship, as we shouldn't have ruined that in the first place. He agreed, but he's become very cold with me. There are boundaries placed between us, and it hurts because it's never the same. I've decided to let go, but it's hard to wrap my head around how someone could just decide they don't want me, and that's it. I love him dearly, and I'm going through the grieving process while watching him finally find peace in his decision, but I feel used and thrown out. I've been having suicidal thoughts, as I don't see a point in living, not because of him entirely, but because I'm not a good person. My whole life is full of rejection because of that (I have lost friends too in the process of all this). Any advice on how to deal with this would be appreciated.

ShameGuilt,Am I a bad person? (self.ShameGuilt),"I have autism and i am hypersexual (and i have many more sexual/mental disorders). When I like a girl, I want to do not appropriate things with them, like most people would (or so I’ve been told). When I do it though, i feel a genuine need to vent this shit, not to be weird but because I literally can’t handle it. I usually only do it with people I trust. I told my ex-friend (and now ex-lover but that’s a long story) that a girl I liked (then hated and now I like her again) would look hot in lingerie. She told that girl, who came up to me and told me to “stop saying stuff like that about (her)”. I felt so bad I cried, and I hate that I cried because i was the one in the wrong, I shouldn’t have been crying. She kept telling it that she forgave me and she just didn’t like it, but I still felt bad. I used to want to (I didn’t but I wanted to) hurt myself because one of her friends, a guy, said she kept calling me creepy, and that makes me cry now because I feel bad. As it turns out, she said I “could be creepy sometimes” one single time, but what if she still feels that way? I really like her, I think I need her, and I really don’t want her to think I’m creepy. She’s so nice and pretty and no one else is nice to me, and I feel creepy admitting that. I wish I was normal. She says she thinks I’m cute and funny but that doesn’t fix anything. I wish I was normal. I want to be better and my friends say I’m a lot better but I don’t feel like that’s true. It should be noted that I said the stuff about lingerie just under a year ago.

ShameGuilt,i am having a panic attack over a guilt and i just want to vent this (self.ShameGuilt),"i regret that i threw away everything that i have with my partner down the drain, we've come so far and we have our whole life ahead of us and i mess it up over my own egoistical thoughts. I was tired of dealing with her due to condition she has yes but it didn't justify me to be angry and start making her feeling insecure, verbally assault her, or even making her want to kill herself, i fucking hate it that i only able to process my emotion so slowly, and when everything is said and done, i realized the mistake i did but it is way too late, i want to apologize and want to be responsible for what i did but she wouldn't let me, she's been in pain and hurt so much by me and she doesn't want me around. i don't know what i can do anymore, i am trying to hurt myself as a way to punish myself, i recluse myself in my room way too ashamed to go out over what i've done to her, i kept saying sorry and beg for forgiveness even though i know that's not how it works but i am so desperate to have redemption, i am so sorry for what i've done i wish i could turn back time and fucking punch myself in the face to teach myself a lesson all i can think about is to find a way to punish myself properly",alezcoed,https://old.reddit.com/r/ShameGuilt/comments/1fo782p/i_am_having_a_panic_attack_over_a_guilt_and_i/
ShameGuilt,feel guilty (self.ShameGuilt),"Wish I could have done things differently Cathy. I’m sorry that I let you down. I was so selfish. I can’t believe it. Selfishness and self-centeredness, we believe that is the core of our problem. You are my daughter. I wasn’t there when you were born. I missed your graduation from high school and college. I’m very sorry. Worried about my little feelings - about not being obeyed. Didn’t want to miss out on my so-called interesting life - I feel like I’m being punished for it now. Have to talk openly now about it. And now you are going to get married and instead of planning for your wedding and heading East I’m working on plans of my own interest. Like from the beginning, if I can just ignore your existence it would be easier for me to- denial. But you don’t know what it’s like to have a child on this planet that you can’t see and that you can’t acknowledge. I don’t know why things are the way that they are. I didn’t make them this way. And I always knew that we had like some kind of a personality conflict. I got your Mom pregnant and then she left town with you. But I admit that I was relieved. rather than owning up to it at the time. I still don’t want to own up to it. I still feel guilty. And you won’t forgive me. It’s so bizarre having a child. You don’t know what it’s like. It like haunts you. You can’t pretend like you don’t have one. God and nature puts a heavy burden on your heart. If you are not there with them you suffer. And then your Mother left and I was left to deal with the loss - the loss even of my own Mother. You being taken away from me was like when my Mother passed away. And yet on some level I was somehow relieved. It doesn’t make any sense. And I know that I should go to your wedding. I should own up to it. And yet I am very afraid - I don’t want to go - I don’t want to own up to this - I want to hide. I want to pretend like it’s just not happening. Just like when your Mom was pregnant and when she went back to her home town 1000 miles away. I was relieved. Relieved of the responsibility. And yet I still thought of you. I still thought of your existence. My child is here on the planet and I am not here with her. I am not with you Cathy and I should be with you. Just like the feeling that my Mom should be with us. She shouldn’t be in heaven. She should be here on earth. I was only 3 years old when you died Mom. Not even yet 3 years old. And it feels like through Cathy you have returned Mom. And yet I am not there. I am not there experiencing it. I am chickening out. My life has been interrupted. With this uneducated but kind Mexican woman. You remind me of the resurrection of Chenta. And where Chenta is I can soon find my Mom. And that’s who I think you are Cathy. You are my Mom returned through a child. Just like Jesus returned. You also returned. Like the Dalai Lama returns in another person. You have returned to us Mother. To somehow save our family. It is true. To save my Dad and the errors he has made. He has married several women and it hasn’t worked out for him trying to recreate the family without you Mom. They are just like place holders waiting for you to return Mom. Just mere place holders waiting for you to return Mom. I can’t believe it. Cathy I can’t believe I left you alone in Frank. I wanted to both be with and be without you. And yet. I couldn’t both be with you and be without you. I guess it was the guilt that I felt. Always looking at me - wondering why I’m not staying there with you. And when I am with you I felt guilty - like I’d let you down. Like I’d let everybody down. In a way didn’t own up to it. Let your Mother down. And let you down as well. I’m very sorry. I didn’t want my life to be this way. I had know idea that the past would catch up to me this way. I worked for so long just to have my future center around my Dad. I just wanted my life to be my Dad and the future we were going to have together. United as a permanent team and family. Studying NE was going to be the nuclear glue to keep us together. But it was short-lived. It was built on sand. I couldn’t make it permanent. And then here at night I am reminded of what happened and how I ran from it. How I ran from you Cathy. And you knew what was going on. That’s why you saw right through me. You knew I was being a coward. I didn’t even tell my family about you. I. didn’t even tell me Dad although he knew cuz I think my brother told him. He told me to do the right thing in an abstract manner. I didn’t know how to tell him that your Mom was still married to another man. She left him never to return but not sure if that constitutes adultery. And it seems like that is what my Dad engaged in with my previous step-Mom. And he seems to have gotten away with it. Not racked by guilt. But why can’t I get away from it. I was like drawn to CJS like a moth to a flame. I was stuck. I had to back over and over again. Like returning to the scene of a crime. Where my Mom died. And yet she returned through you Cathy. But I couldn’t tell you about it. I couldn’t tell anybody about it. Only kindly Pat knew. Such a gentle kind soul. Thanks Pat for being my friend and holding my confidences. You are a good Man. Oh how petty it is to be a human. With our petty little secrets. Our petty sneakiness thinking we are getting away with something. But God sees and he exposes us. We are doomed to correct our errors. We must make things right. Right the wrong so to speak. Be rigorously honest. And yet what I want to do is hide out. I want to run away and hide out. Be as far away from you as a can. China. And yet that is still not yet far enough to hide my head in shame. Because I let you down and your nature is not to forgive. Your nature is to remind me that I let you down. That I wasn’t there. I didn’t do the needful - I didn’t create a happy family unit with L. I should have. But we were mismatched. You have to understand Cathy. We were greatly mismatched. I wish I had done things differently and I with there were no consequences in my soul for not doing the needful as society would so dictate. I wish that I didn’t chicken out. Admit to the world. My Mom died in a car accident in CJS and she has returned through Cathy and I just can’t believe it. it is too much for me. I can’t face it. And so I return to CJS night after night. Almost every day I have to return to CJS. To listen to that loud music. Drink alcohol. That loud beat. Like tribal music. Calling me back to you and my Mom. Just waiting for you to return. Just waiting for you to return to me. So I had to go and find you Cathy and bring you back to CJS. Then to Larry who represented my Mom. We were all back together first with Chenta who represented your Mom. Than larry who represented the memory of my Mom. trying hard to recreate the past. How can I do it. How can I do it Cathy. What can I do to get away with this. What can I do to not betray you. What can I do to face up to everything. I just want to hide. I want to live my Dad’s life. I want to live somebody else’s life. My life is just a fantasy. it’s not real. I have created a fantasy life for myself that I can’t live in because it isn’t real. It just isn’t real Cathy. I can see that now. i can see that now. Running to and fro. Texas to California back to Texas to Georgia to Brazil to Mexico to Argentina and then later to China. Looking for you and then finding you and then running away again. running away from myself and destiny. How can you run away from yourself tell me how to do it? I just can’t figure it out. I was so naive I guess is the word. Or rather, traumatized I guess is the word they use now. Can I really go to NC to your wedding? I mean, do you even exist? To face your husband and his family. I created this situation and I just can’t own up to it. I feel ashamed and guilty. That’s why I’m on this forum. Spilling my guts. Being honest for once. I was a coward and in a way I still am. I have a daughter. First she was taken from me and then she was brought back to me to make things whole but I just couldn’t bear it. I didn’t want to confront it. The tremendous love that I felt. And then the tremendous responsibility. To face the Universe and destiny and the miracle of life itself. Just tell me that I did the right thing by you Cathy. Paz y amor. Just tell me please that after all is said and done, I owned up to my mistakes. But I want to hide from your husband. I want to hide from your husband’s parents. I want to find a hole and bury myself in it. I don’t want to admit what I have done. A new life has been created seemingly out of nothing. But somehow you were always there. Born of the spirit of my Mother. The miracle of life and yet others pretend like it is commonplace. I should be loyal to all of humanity. Kiss the floor of this world. Kiss the floor of this life. mateo I am afraid to face you. I am afraid to face your parents over what I have done. i ran and hid. I didn’t marry your future wife’s mother and I am sorry. It was all a big mistake and I’m very sorry. I was a coward. I still am. And I want to feign some type of false self-righteousness - I wasn’t aware of my actions. I shirked my responsibilities and I want to get away with it scot-free. But shame and guilt won’t let me. Built into my soul by God and nature. I can run but I can’t hide. My soul is forcing me to do the right thing. Even though I don’t want to. I want to continue hiding out. I want to continue running. Pretending like your Mom is not there in old Mexico. That I can keep you secret. but children our born by the will of God. I was just there present. God wanted you to be born in the manner you were born and to your parents. It seems like you do accept that. You do accept your relationship with Mateo. Your place in this world. You accept your Mom and in a way you even accept me. I know that it has been hard for both of us. And I am just barely talking about it now. That strange feeling of having a daughter so far away and that crazy feeling of not knowing what to do. Not knowing in which direction to run and hide. And to pretend like I didn’t know what happened. I can ignore the fruits of my actions. But I can’t. To try to go on and have some kind of a meaningful life without you. With you in hiding and far away from me. The further the better. China. I can hide out in China with a new language. Far from you and your Mom. i can learn Chinese and escape you and destiny. Guilt and Shame behind me. I can outrun guilt and shame and my responsibility. How do others cope with this. They must not have a conscience. it seems like it would be wonderful to not have a conscience. To be free. To do what you want and then to just wonderfully skip town. to run far far far away. to take a shortcut. But my padrino said I have to own up and face this. Face Mateo’s parents. I want to have some medication Testosterone. Psychiatric Medication. Xanax. Paxil. Alcohol. The fantasy of the not too distant future that i can run too. But I can’t run from you Cathy. From those watching eyes. Yes I can’t run away from you Cathy. You being with Mateo now is feel like somehow I am losing you. I need to own up to who i am. Have to start getting closer to NC. To start planning my trip. To do things correctly. I want to be able to do things correctly for once. But I want to run from this again. run from the heart palpitations. Run from my destiny. But I can’t do it. My soul won’t let me chicken out. You won’t let me chicken out Cathy. Somehow you are controlling. How can I make things up to you? You are somehow are my conscience. I want to run away. I want your approval. I want you to tell me that i did things right. That I am a good Dad. That you forgive me for my errors. But I can’t force you to do that. I see that now. I want to take a poetry class. To run and hide from you. To be an empty shell. To pretend like nothing ever happened. That I could just freely go about my life unencumbered. Unfettered. Free as the proverbial bird. But that just isn’t possible anymore. I know that now. Can’t I just somehow start over? go back to the beginning. Want to take a poetry class. Stay in denial. Pretend like you aren’t getting married. That I can run from it. I can somehow hide out. I guess i need to get to NC as quickly as possible.",Professional-Day168,https://old.reddit.com/r/ShameGuilt/comments/1f02lcu/feel_guilty/

ShameGuilt,A rant (self.ShameGuilt),"When I was a kid, I can’t remember how young, I would go on sites aimed at adults and I remember a certain one where I messaged someone who was probably an adult there in an inappropriate manner. I didn’t show them pictures or anything, but the reason I feel guilty about this is because they probably didn’t know I was underage. Even if I was 15 or so I should’ve known better but I didn’t, so it feels like I’ve assaulted someone since they didn’t consent to not knowing that information and the site itself probably would’ve said that it was 18+. Unrelated, but I’m terrified at the prospect of turning 20. My Birthday is in about 10 days and I’m still alone, meanwhile my options shrink as people continue to get married and meet other people. A lot of 20 year olds have also probably had full on sex, which is something I wanted to save until I was sure the person I was with was right in order to experience that with them, but what if they don’t exist or if someone that would’ve been that person found their version of that.

ShameGuilt,Before and after guilt (self.ShameGuilt),"It's strange, yk. How the World is now. Since it all became, since i've lost myself to guilt. I forgot how was the World before. How to appreciate the wind on my skin. How to look at the sky and close my eyes, smiling as the sun come through anyway. I forgot the way to really appreciate the taste of what i eat. I forgot the way talking to people was always making me blush. I forgot how easy it was to walk, to sit down, to read, to work, to do anything. Even some moment i thought to be the worst if my life are now at my eyes more joyful. Innocent. Now, it's but a heavy boulder in my stomach, a brick in my head, and all colour are like hidden by smoke and distorted. But sometimes, i see it. For a few second, i just remember how it was. How easy it was to smile, how the bird singing where making me comfortable. Now it's ended. And forever. I won't smile the same way. I won't feel the World around me the same way. All i feel is guilt, so much that it became ordinary. It never really goes. For this, death are sometimes an idea to be happier about. Not existing, is having nothing like this boulder. It's pure freedom, somehow. Or it's hell. And as i don't know, i prefere not to try anything. And i see it everywhere, in almost everyone. This way to exist. I would have prefered being victim of some of the worst thing but having to face what i've became. But it's not a choice i have. So i have to see people smile like i did, seeing the World with clear eyes. And i exactly know what i'll be doing right now. I would just put the music up, and working with a smile... Even if heavily distracted by the music. I hope for anyone to not understand what i say. Hell, i wouldn't wish Adolf to have felt this way, freaking Adolf H, or anyone really.

ShameGuilt,thats the life (self.ShameGuilt),"I guess theres no dodging the fact that some people like my girlfriend wouldnt like me to keep apologizing, or feeling guilty about small little mistakes, and as much as i dont want to spiral its not so much a reality that is as pointy and poignant as others make it to be. If you were me long enough and i assure you, you wouldn't want to be me for any length of time even now in my growing years where i'm ""doing better"" (but at the same time far worse) if you were me for any length of time you would expect yourself to do better or be better than yourself, and once the decision to do right actually comes and you crumble and can't do it, theres definitely some comfort in being sad that regardless of whether or not you'd actually do it that you wouldn't be proud of it. That is to say that im glad i hate myself because at least i have a conscience, at least i have the decency to be delusional and not put myself above others. yes, i treat it as a mistake that i didn't kill myself but its whatever, i can't grow, i can't change as much as i would like to its not something thats up to me since ive thrown my will to God and He gets to decide my happiness for me.

ShameGuilt,I should have been more patient with my grandmother all this time? (self.ShameGuilt),"So I am 29, my grandmother is 85. This year she seems to have significant hearing loss and now is showing signs of cognitive decline. My grandmother is a very controlling person with no filter and a hypocritical moral compass. I know it sounds like I'm being mean right now but I'm just being honest trying to provide some context. She guilted my mom into adopting my nephew when I was 13 and he was 6. My mom was almost free (for lack of a better word). My brother was a drug addict and lost him. My mom of course loves her grandson but due to circumstances and her mental illness, my mom never felt her life mattered and she told me that. It still breaks my heart. She died from cancer at 57 and she just deserved so much more out of life. Could she have had boundaries and told my grandmother no and moved away from her? Yes. I wish she did. My mom lost her dad at 12 and had a traumatic life so I think she just didn't have much emotional strength for it. There is more but I still think my grandmother has good intentions, she's just selfish and a busy body. I don't think her intention is to hurt people but she only cares about her own conscience being clear. Hence wanting my mom to adopt my nephew so that he didn't end up in the system. When my mom died my grandmother became his guardian (he was 14) but made him everyone else's responsibility. I see him acting entitled and lazy and disrespectful just like my brother so I tried disciplining him. I was just told I'm horrible and ""should never have kids"". So she didn't want to do the work. She enables him just like she did my brother (who is now 45 and has a novel for a record). Her and I get along 80% of the time but I have always told her off or not kept quiet when I disagree or feel she's being ridiculous. She does have good qualities but some things she does rub me the wrong way. But I feel I should have just accepted her as she is. Being elderly she is not going to change her ways and I feel bad for the times I could have been softer towards her. I never met her parents but I'm sure it's generational trauma of some kind. She expected me to sacrifice my free time as a kid to watching my nephew so she could go do what she wanted. My mom complained of being stuck in the house and my grandmother would say take him to the park. I could go on and on but I just have mixed feelings over this as she does love and care for me and I have since moved away from her so boundaries are easier but I do have love for her and it'll hurt to lose her one day 😢",Acadiavibes,https://old.reddit.com/r/ShameGuilt/comments/1dlaekr/i_should_have_been_more_patient_with_my/
ShameGuilt,"Confession: I didn't realize how toxic of a person I was until I finally lost my virginity. Feel a lot of guilt about the way I handled past situations and the way I lost my virginity too (Don't worry, nothing illegal, just feel like a bad person) (self.ShameGuilt)","I tried to post this on r/incelexit but my karma is too low and got deleted. Hopefully, this is the right place to post. I never realized how toxic I was until about 6 months ago. Sex was the only thing that was on my mind and thought that finally getting it would help me lose that loser label and that I would finally be a normal college student. I thought that everyone in my school and everyone from my old high school were having great sex lives, while I was left behind. I started blaming the whole thing on my height after I tried talking to a girl and eventually she became friends with my friends. My friends told me that she said she'd never date a short guy. I slowly distanced myself from her, started coming to class late so I would have to see her less, especially after she started talking about a new coworker that she really liked. A high schooler who was also taller than me. Me going out of my way to avoid her probably made me look really stupid now that I think of it. That crushed me and I started to believe all women thought like that. It doesn't help that my friends have told me that they think I might be autistic (higher functioning). I told my brother and told me thought the same thing lol. Later, I got into contact with someone I knew from high school that probably had a crush on me. I know, really stupid to believe that people wouldn't change after 2 years. In high school, she dropped hints that I now recognize, but at the time I thought she was kidding. Plus, I was too obsessed with a girl I never talked to in my 4 years of high school. Anyway, this girl was happy to hear from me after a while, but after texting for a few days it became apparent that any interest she had in me had gone away. She suggested coffee and studying, but eventually she started making excuses that she was too busy and eventually stopped responding, which I don't blame her for. At the time, I felt like she was my only hope at finding ""love"" and maybe she started getting those vibes. Around this time, I met with a counselor who said that I have very unhealthy boundaries and even gave me a list of them to print out. Anyway, as to how I lost my virginity, I lost it to a guy I met online, not even on a dating app. I'm bisexual, but closeted since I live with family. I was feeling pretty lonely and thought I couldn't get a girlfriend. So, I thought I could improve my social skills by making friends since I only have 2 and by the time I'm writing this post I feel like they no longer enjoy hanging out with me as much as before. Anyway, I started talking to this new online friend and it was pretty apparent that he was gay and would call me flirty names. I really liked the attention. Most of the attention I had received in my life was from other guys, even in middle school where I was at my ugliest. I was really fat and wore ugly glasses, but I had a friend who was probably gay for me. I finally met up with this guy, who turned out to look very different from his profile picture, but I decided to give him a chance anyway. We hung out a couple of times and got food together. Eventually, I mustered up the courage to ask him if he wanted to have sex, which to my surprise he did. I explicitly told him that I wanted it because I was tired of being inexperienced at my age. So, we had sex and I told him that I wasn't looking for anything serious. It was a lot of fun and I felt like I finally got to join that club that so many others had. But this is where the feelings of shame came in. What would my family think if they knew I lost my virginity to a guy and not a girl? And also, I used this guy to validate myself. We didn't hang out for a few months, but we didn't stop talking. I was scared to hang out again, since I felt awkaward and didn't want things to get sexual. We would still text each other. Eventually, he suggested we meet up again for food and I said sure, but he couldn't make it. A week after I suggested the same idea, but he had something come up. Later, he suggested meeting up for food and sex again, to which I agreed, but he couldn't make it either since he was busy working towards his new career. One thing that makes me feel like I used him is the fact that at this point I no longer felt like having sex with him. Last time, it took a lot of courage for me to have done that, since I have so much internalized homophobia and had a fear of being seen as feminine. At this point his career required him to be elsewhere and I no longer saw him again. I feel so guilty about that, because he was genuinely a nice guy to be around with, it's just that I cared so much about what everyone thought about me. Whether that was about me being a virgin or liking guys. We kept texting for the next two months without meeting up. Just about how our days had been and stuff like that. I began to distance myself since I was scared of the possibility of having sex again, sex that I no longer wanted. After realizing how bad this was, I decided to send him a message simply telling him that if he returns, I'm down to hang out with him and that we can go eat somewhere. There is another thing that makes me feel horrible and like a predator. We talked about our past experiences and even traumas. He told me that he is closeted as well just like me. Also, I told him about a near death experience and the PTSD I got as a result and he told me that he was once sexually assaulted. I hope that what happened didn't give him any sort of negative flashbacks. I don't know, sometimes I feel like I'm no better than the guy that sexually assaulted him. Another friend of mine told me recently that he was sexually assaulted in the past and I already feel like distancing myself from him. I no longer feel the urge to find a gf, and when it comes to gay guys I feel guilty about befriending them and feel like I should avoid them at all costs. I posted something similar to this on a gay advice subreddit and was told that gay men despise guys like me and that I should stick to women only.",CoolAssignment3300,https://old.reddit.com/r/ShameGuilt/comments/1dd78mh/confession_i_didnt_realize_how_toxic_of_a_person/

He was just a crude, horribly annoying person who seemingly took enjoyment out of making everyone around him uncomfortable. He was like a mix of Todd Packer from the Office and Tony Soprano. He always brought these apple chips into work to eat for lunch, and occasionally I would go in, take the apple chips, and go to the nearby park and eat them for lunch. He would go around asking everyone if they took the chips and would act all pissed off because he knew someone took them. Instead of just flat out telling him I'm allergic to apples, I put on a little show. He was eating his chips 2 days before I started to take them, and I asked if I could have one, and I took one and almost took a bite, then said ""these aren't apple flavored are they?"" and he said they were, then I quickly put it back on the plate and went to go wash my hands and I said I was allergic. Much more believable than me just flat out telling him. This went on for about 2 months. I must have taken his chips like 10~ times or so.",willmaster123,https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/c3sxsu/i_used_to_eat_my_coworkers_apple_chips_at_work/
confession,I shit in a mason jar and left it in my friends pantry.Light (self.confession),"Here we go. About 13 years ago my 19 year old self was partying at a friends house. There was probably a good 20-25 people packed inside this 1000sqf house. I had been drinking Mikes Hard Lemonade and Tampon Blender Benders all night long. Full disclosure; I have an allergy involving certain alcohols that can cause severe hives, swollen throat, and intense diarrhea. I was 19, and stupid. Anyways, I was chatting with my gal pal at the time and felt the inevitable groan of my stomach. “Shit” I thought. Figuratively and literally. I asked where the bathroom was, and she pointed down the hall. I squeezed myself through the teenage crowd only to find a ridiculously long line of women waiting to use the toilet. My bowels were screaming. The cramps were intensifying. I recalled seeing a toilet closet in the basement of the house once before and decided to take my chances. I darted down the stairs all while puckering my pooper with all the strength in me. It was dark so I flipped the light switch and saw the porcelain throne glowing in the corner of the room. I slam the door behind me and shove my pants down around my ankles. I make a swift penguin waddle over to the toilet. To my surprise, the toilet isn’t connected to the plumbing! It’s just sitting in the corner of the room. A failed attempt at a bathroom remodel, I had put myself in a perilous poo-position with no escape. People saw me come down here, there’s no way I could poo in the toilet and get away with it. By now anus was on fire. I could barely hold it in much longer. I panicked. I scanned the room and noticed an open mason jar filled with potpourri with the lid laying beside it on a shelf. My mind was made up. I snatched the mason jar from the shelf and promptly dumped the potpourri into the empty toilet bowl. Ever so carefully I placed the mason jar on the floor of the bathroom and popped a squat over it. Spreading my cheeks and with surgical precision, I shat my brains out in that jar. I filled that sucker to the brim. I released the kraken of anal sighs and never felt such relief before in my life. But what now? What do I do? I can’t leave it in here! I hear my friends calling me from upstairs that they were wanting to leave. I needed an escape plan, now! Quickly I pulled up my pants (wiping was not an option, but I’d pinched off like 99.99% of my shit, so it was clean enough) and placed the lid on the mason jar. It was warm. So warm. Still unsure of what to do next, I hide the jar under my hoodie and exit the bathroom as if nothing happened. “What were you doing down there?” My friend asked. “Just freshening up” I said, in absolute horror that she may notice my mason jar shit smuggling. “Hurry up, we’re all in the kitchen waiting to leave” She barks. I swim through the crowd of people to the kitchen to meet my friends. They’re all crowded around the pantry door which was next to the door to the garage. “There you are!” They holler as they open the door to the garage. Here’s my chance. The door to the garage was blocking the visual to the pantry. I did it. I slide the smuggled shit jar out from under my sweater and place it next to identical jars in the pantry. And promptly left with my friends. To this day, I wonder. I wonder with so much wonderment that I wonder how I’ve never been caught. Did they ever locate this jar and open it? Was it assumed beef stew? Was it tasted? Smelled? Tossed? I regret this. But I was desperate. This is my poo-fession. EDIT: Thanks for the silver, stranger! I’m shocked, amazed, and mildly disturbed that you’re all so fascinated with my story. EDIT 2: You’ve all warmed my heart like the mason jar warmed my hands with your comments on my writing. I am not a writer, but I always enjoyed journaling and telling stories. Albeit, exaggerated ones. You guys are great. Keep that shit up.

confession,I knowingly stuck a booger to my bosses hand and let a customer get blamed for it. (self.confession),"A few years ago, I was a salesman for a tool company and as I’m sure you all know sales people shake hands all the time when closing a deal. So one day on my lunch break I was sitting in my car eating my salad, and for some reason I felt like a hard dried snot stuck in my nostril. So obviously I didn’t think anybody was around or watching me so I went and dug for gold. Well as soon as I pulled the giant flakey booger with a snail trail of slime on it, my boss who just got back from vacation, and bops the hood of my car and reaches in for a handshake. I kindof panic’d and just shook his hand. We talked for a few about his vacation, and then he saw somebody walk into the showroom so he went in the building. I finished up lunch and headed back in to work. I punch back in, and I just hear from the show room “WHAT THE F*” and then I hear gagging and coughing. My boss is holding his hand away like it’s a dirty diaper, he’s dry heaving and he says “that guy just whiped a F-ing booger on me!” and I look across the room and see this old guy standing there in total disbelief and he let my boss have it. He’s telling my boss he’s never coming back, told him to stop picking his nose like a “window-licker” and a few other colorful sentences. My boss kicks him out. While this whole thing is going down, all I can think to myself is holy shit, I got away with it. I just drove by my old work, and thought about that time and figured it was time to confess.",Count_Spectre,https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/imlghu/i_knowingly_stuck_a_booger_to_my_bosses_hand_and/
confession,I used to be a white supremacist - Please read the whole thing before postingSupport Only (self.confession),"About a year ago I joined a group of men that advocate for white nationalism and other far right nonsense. Too be honest I didn't care or like any of these people in the slightest. The only reason joined them was because some of my friends were going to that ""Side"" of the political spectrum and they were getting angry about stupid political shit like I was. I did a lot of crazy stuff like vandalism and basically getting drunk with other skin heads and Aryan brotherhood drug dealers. I slide down this kind of spectrum, I acted like a fool and made myself look stupid. Eventually after a few crazy events happened I stopped talking to my white nationalist friend and started doing my own thing for a while through mostly work. I got this crazy idea to actually go to a Synagogue, a Mosque , and a church just out of fun. When I went to these places almost all of those people treated me very well, including an elderly Jewish couple. They treated me like a part of their own family and introduced me to their kids. The Muslims treated me the same way and even gave me some free classes about the Quran. But I think the worst part of all was when I went to a catholic church and I saw every race on the face of the planet in this small town I used to live in. And I felt so bad about this whole thing. Because I had judged a lot of these people before they even knew me. But In all honesty I'm sorry I did some bad things to these people and I don't want any harm to them. I guess I'm glad that God helped me realize what I did was wrong and I don't want anyone to do the same things I did. But again I'm sorry for what I did I hope some of you can forgive me.",,https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/92v55c/i_used_to_be_a_white_supremacist_please_read_the/

confession,"I stole a book from the library page by page, then glued the pieces together at home (self.confession)","I was about 10 and I was addicted to read encyclopedias. I could spend hours learning about all sorts of stuff, staring at the illustrations and photos, and of course, smelling the books. However, I could get my fix at my local library only as my parents could barely afford food for us, let alone buying fancy books. So, I became a regular guest at the kids/teenager section of the library. One day I couldn't get there in time, so I only had about half an hour to spend before closing time. Not just that, but they also had a brand new, 400 page encyclopedia waiting for me on the shelf. It was love on the first sight. I felt awful, because I knew that I couldn't do much reading in such a little time, and then there was this lovely smelling book with a montage of astronauts, cars and magnificent landscapes on the front cover just begging me to read it. Sadly, books like those were not borrowable and time was ticking. I thought about 'taking it', but it was just enormous and I wasn't. I wasn't a bad boy either, I told myself. But what if I just take a few pages? That surely won't hurt anyone, and noone will notice it missing. That's what I did. The book was binded in a way, that I could carefully rip about 5 pages out in one go. I wrapped the pages around my foot, slipped them in my socks, covered my socks with my pants and I just casually walked out. The first time I actually said 'Thank you very much' with a big smile to the librarian and she gave me that awkward 'What the heck are you talking about?' look. My 10 years old mind quickly realised how stupid I was to say that and I, maybe even my parents could be in jail for this, so I just rushed out, sweating and with my heart jumping out of my chest. Originally I wanted to return the pages at the next visit to the library. But as I was sitting on my bed at home, reading about the wildlife in Africa (the only content I got at the time), I came up with the masterplan of repeating the process until I get every page. And the plan was working! Not just that, but I improved on the technique. I wrapped pages around my feet, around my arms (had to wear long sleeve for that) and also kept a stack on my back, tucked carefully in my pants. I could get about 20-25 pages in just one day. I remember walking slowly like a robot on my way out as I didn't want to crush the pages too much. I couldn't bend in any direction because the pages were holding my limbs tight. After several visits to the library the encyclopedia began to visibly shrink. So I got some paper from the photocopy room and replaced the missing pages with blank ones. My last visit was the sketchiest, because I had to take the trophy somehow. By trophy I mean the hard cover with the astronauts on. There was no way to wrap it like I did with the pages and it was too big to hide it anywhere on me. But I was so close to victory, I couldn't let it go. I had the shiny cover in its full glory, in my hand. I put it under my t-shirt, on my back. Hands in my pocket, trying to hold the cover with my elbows. I was scared to the bone that they will catch me and send me to jail. I checked my reflection in the window. I looked like a terrified Lady Gaga with fake shoulderpads. But I was also shameless by this time, I knew I was an awful person. It was nearly 5 o'clock and every librarygoer left, the librarians were doing their closing up routines so the front desk was abandoned. I just walked out without anyone noticing me. I glued all the pages and the cover together at home. The book was nowhere near as majestic as before, but I loved it anyway. I have never ever stolen anything else in my life, and I am so sorry for this.",fm837,https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/dxre3f/i_stole_a_book_from_the_library_page_by_page_then/

I called his father (pizza owner) to complain, and he told me that his kid dont get mad if he wasnt right, and told me to put the pizza in the microwave and hung up. I was mad af. I decided to wait untill i cool off and think about what to do. So the next morning, i called the pizza from a phonebooth and ordered almost 80$ worth of pizza. I gave them the adress of the appartement next to me wich was empty. I turned off my TV so i can hear him coming. He came more than an hour later and start knocking the door. Of course no one responded. He insisted by knocking loudly. So i opened my door, and sees him with a ton of pizza. I just laughed and closed my door.

confession,I went to the grocery store today to purchase tomatoes (self.confession),"I bought three tomatoes. Two were “on the vine” for $1.89/lb. One was a big fat juicy “hot house” tomato at $3.89/lb. I used self checkout and purchased all three at the “on the vine” price. On the drive home I told my wife what I did.

Adding to my mischievous ways, I then told her how I gently held the thin produce bag off the scale a bit to reduce the actual weight. Aaaaaaahahahahahahaha. She’s not talking to me at the moment.

confession,"I lied and took a company asset home. I got caught, fired, and four years later I still regret it. (self.confession)","This happened four years ago, and I still think about it almost every day. I worked in an IT department for 8 years, and part of my job was managing company assets. There was a TV in storage that hadn’t been used for years. Nobody ever mentioned it, nobody cared about it—at least that’s what I told myself. So I decided to take it home. But I didn’t just take it quietly. I made up a story and filled out a request form saying I was moving the TV to a supplier’s location. A complete lie. The truth is, I was taking it home for myself. I created that fake excuse to make it seem legitimate, and I handed the form in like everything was fine. The guard saw me taking the TV, took a picture, and reported it. That’s how it got exposed. Everything escalated fast. It became a big issue in the company. I returned the TV within a few days, but the damage was already done. At the time, I was so defensive. I told myself, “It’s just a TV. What’s the big deal?” I felt like people were overreacting and gossiping unnecessarily. But in truth, I had lied, manipulated the system, and broken trust. My boss was disappointed. They didn’t say much—they just ended my contract quietly. I didn’t get a chance to explain. I lost the job, and even worse, I lost all my friends there. People cut me off, unfollowed or blocked me on social media. No one reached out, no one asked what really happened. I became the center of gossip, even among people who had already left the company. I know what I did was wrong. I was manipulative. I was persistent. I thought I could get away with it. And now, years later, it still haunts me. I miss my coworkers—not even one person in particular, just the group moments, the laughter, the feeling of belonging. I didn’t take the TV because I needed it. I think I just wanted a small win. A sense of control. Something that felt like mine in a job where I felt invisible. I regret it deeply. And I don’t know if people ever really forgive you for something like this.

confession,I stole a girls iPod Touch and then sold it back to her a month later (self.confession),"It’s 2011, I’m in Year 7, it’s my first year in high school and I got sent somewhere where I literally only knew one person, and we never spoke. A few months into the year and I’m sitting in Math class and this one girl who I just could not stand (and who also bullied me on and off) kept just interrupting for the stupidest of things, and just generally kept getting on my nerves the whole lesson. Part way through the lesson the teacher tells us to leave our things in the classroom so we could go to the computer lab, and I was the last to leave the classroom. Note that most kids hid their iPods under their pencil cases during class so they could get away with using it, and I knew for a fact she’d left it there. I don’t know what possessed me to steal her iPod, but I did. She never found out. But now, I leave school, the iPod is still in my shorts pocket. Nobody knows what I’ve done. The girl thinks one of the guys was screwing with her and doesn’t suspect me at all. Now the one defining feature of her iPod was that the back was completely covered in small circle stickers. Ones that had gotten so worn down they’d almost fused with the device. So I did what I could and I scrubbed those fuckers off until it looked brand new. I didn’t use it at all, in fear of my mum seeing it and screaming at me for being a thief. So it just sat in my room gathering dust, until about a month later I overhear her asking some people if they know anyone selling an iPod. One week later and I’d made $150 by selling a girl her own iPod that’d just been factory reset and scrubbed down.",onmywaytoday,https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/fvxkyi/i_stole_a_girls_ipod_touch_and_then_sold_it_back/

confession,i kicked a hitchhiker out of my car in the middle of the desert (self.confession),"About 8 months ago, I was driving alone on a trip to visit my parents. Most of this drive goes through a desolate desert with barely any vegetation. Approx. an hour into the drive I saw a 20-30 year old with shorts, t-shirt, backpack, and a water bottle giving me the thumbs up on the side of the road. Considering the road is less used nowadays, I decided to help him out because it didn't seem like he would see anyone else that day. At first he seemed quite normal at first but after we introduced each other and had a couple conversations, he started to act strangely. He would occasionally flick his head twice and make a face, but would continue with the conversation like nothing happened. about 30 mins after driving him, he started talking politics and was VERY adamant on his way of viewing things being ''correct"". I wasn't afraid of sharing my own thoughts and opinions, so I did as respectfully as I could. Without warning he cut me off mid-sentence and screamed at the top of his lungs. I was shocked and really didn't know what to do (looking back he was obviously on drugs). He pushed me past the point of comfort in my own vehicle at that point, so I pulled over and ordered him to get out of my car. He took his stuff and once outside I zoomed off, leaving him at least 30km away from the nearest town. Later, when I arrived at my parents house, I looked over to the passenger side door, and he left his water bottle! I assume he was fine, but who knows, maybe I killed some druggie because I didn't look to my right for a couple hours.",giraffetooth,https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/lwhvcu/i_kicked_a_hitchhiker_out_of_my_car_in_the_middle/
confession,"I learned something about my mom's past, and I feel like I've stolen something from her.Remorse (self.confession)","For context, I'm a 25yo woman. Last month, I was at my parent’s house. I was helping my mom with something when I noticed a piece of paper barely sticking out of a folder. All I could see was a title that ended with the phrase “As Rape Survivor” and something that looked like my sister’s name next to the right margin on the second line. Yes, I know, I shouldn’t have read it. But I dare you not to do the same in my position. There was a split second where I considered pretending I’d never seen it. But selfishly, I thought I had to know. And naively, I thought that whatever I could imagine could be worse than what had happened. After all, my mother was and is a popular likable extrovert who drank like a fish in college and always had a date to dances. And well, norms have changed. There are experiences that might seem like rape in hindsight that would not have been considered so at the time. I was expecting a story involving fuzzy boundaries and fuzzy memories, the edges worn down by the decades passed since. It wasn't that I wanted to invalidate her experience precisely, but mentally minimize it so that I could neatly consign it to the same place where I keep stories about her grad school roommates. Until I started reading. It was the kind of rape that people often imagine when they talk about rape. Behind her apartment. By two strangers. At gunpoint. On her 24th birthday. My mother, the woman who believes that people are fundamentally good. My mother, the most empathetic and emotionally intelligent person I’ve ever met. My mother, the woman who leaves our front door unlocked at least 80% of the time. She was raped at gunpoint when she was six months younger than I am now. She talked about how it tested her support network - how her new boyfriend dumped her and how people—female and male alike—asked what she was wearing. How men who had been casually interested in her suddenly treated her like she was infected. The whole essay made me feel nauseous. True to form, her essay framed the aftermath reactions as a valuable relationship litmus test. She severed ties with some friends and drew closer to others. I can't help feeling like I failed the litmus test. By picking up that paper and by making assumptions before I’d even started reading. I betrayed her and stole something that belonged to her.",throwaway24242141,https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/92d9hn/i_learned_something_about_my_moms_past_and_i_feel/

My colleague (30F) is also a paralegal. We’ve both been working there for 2 years. She can be dramatic and gossip-y but other than that she’s good at what she does. She started treating me different ever since my proposal to go part-time got accepted by the executive (due to studies). A lawyer that I’m close with even told me that my colleague said that I suck up to the lawyers (idk how true this is. maybe it was just a misunderstanding? I’m just kind to everyone).

With the recent ""healthy lifestyle"" thing schools were doing, all the soda vending machines were removed. For a while, we were really upset. However, I walked by teachers lounge one day while a teacher had the door open and saw that there was a coke vending machine still in there. Not only that, the price for a single bottle was only $0.50. That was an outright steal to us. We knew we had to get in there. The problem was that the door was constantly locked. We began creating our plan. During lunch hour, we scoped out the normal HS building. Since it was lunch, all students were required to be in the cafeteria. However, we knew a way to have access to the building was to get lunch detention. Kids in detention were released 20 minutes late for lunch. The easiest way to do that was to not turn in Biology worksheets. 3 Zeroes in biology and a few late lunches later, We found out that one of the teachers would leave a key in the door for easy access. On the fourth day, we put our plan into action. B would watch the door, as I slipped into the lounge after the teachers had gotten their lunch. I made my way to the machine with a dollar in quarters. On the way, I noticed a bowl in the corner labeled ""soda fund"" with lots of change and dollar bills inside. Greed took over me that day. We ran out of the school building with 3 sodas each. We did this at least 4 more times throughout the rest of the semester. We had to stop after the school installed security cameras. Eventually, the cheap soda machine was removed. Overall, our average in Biology dropped by nearly 15 points. The sodas tasted really good tho.",uhhwae,https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/e8yeq9/my_friend_and_i_lowered_our_gpa_and_broke_into/
confession,I once trucked a girl in high school and it keeps me up at night (self.confession),"In high school I played football and I was pretty tall and big. When walking to classes it actually kind of sucked because I had to stop to let people go into doors so I wouldn’t run into kids because I could accidentally knock somebody over. I had another friend on team who walked with me to class and we would occasionally fuck around in the hallway by pushing each other, just dumb shit. We were messing around when he pushes me when we’re making a turn down the hallway, and I backup and feel something against me. I look down an a poor girl, who was probably a freshman, is laying on the ground. Absolutely terrified. I go down to help her up and my friend still doesn’t understand what’s happening and thinks we’re still messing around, so he pushes me again and I almost ended up trampling her. She got up on her own and rushed down the hallway probably with tears in her eyes because I had just knocked her into a brick wall and onto the ground. I never got reported to a teacher so I’m assuming she had no injuries. This wasn’t the last time something like this happened. I was walking to class after lunch when a friend came over and pushed me as a joke. I said “Get away from me” at the exact same time a girl accidentally hit me while walking by, looked at me super offended and walked off.",MilitaryOrNo,https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/bmi54r/i_once_trucked_a_girl_in_high_school_and_it_keeps/
confession,I exaggerated my daughters symptoms so the doctors would do tests. (self.confession),"I want to start by saying I don’t not have munchausen syndrome. I love my kids and I don’t want them to be sick. Anyways, my daughter started having episodes of breath holding, abnormal eye movements, and lethargic type symptoms after these episodes. The first time it happened I took her in and truthfully told them what happened. I was told “it’s probably breath holding spells. It’s pretty scary for new moms” and we were sent home. The “diagnosis” didn’t sit right with me. Over the course of a month the episodes were more frequent. Happening everyday, multiple times a day. She had an episode where it lasted 2 minutes. So I took her to the er, exaggerated the symptoms and they did additional tests (24 hr. Eeg and MRI). The tests confirmed that she in fact has epilepsy not breath holding spells.",Key-Temporary628,https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/16utgk9/i_exaggerated_my_daughters_symptoms_so_the/
confession,I forged Good Charlotte's signature for a Nintendo (self.confession),"When I was 8 there was a boy in my 3rd grade class who was obsessed with the band Good Charlotte. He had this blue Nintendo Game Boy that I had been eyeing for a while, and I decided to propose a trade. I told him that I actually knew Benji and Joel Madden (lead singers of the band) and that I had their autographs. I told him I'd trade him the autographs for his Game Boy and he enthusiastically agreed. I went home and spent a good 20-30 mins with my next door neighbor forging their signatures. After we agreed on one we used her parents lamination machine to make it really legit. The next day he handed over his Game Boy in return for the fake autographs. A week later my little brother was playing with the Game Boy and dropped it in the bathtub.

confession,I purposefully screwed up someone's car door in a crowded parking lot one day. (self.confession),"My wife and I were homeless at the time and living out of my car. We were at the library one day, my wife was inside trying to get some paperwork done and trying to get us any help she could, while I was in the car using my laptop and the library's wifi to fill out job applications. I was in thus crowded parking lot when this suv pulled into the spot next to me. Real fancy shiny vehicle, though I couldn't tell you make or model. This tall skinny woman with a Karen haircut throws her door open and dings the shit out of my car. It shocked me so I looked up. She climbs out of the car and LOCKS EYES with me, but doesn't say a word. No sorry, no my bad, nothing. To be fair, my car was a beater and if she would have apologized I would have laughed and said something like ""please, you couldn't make this car look any worse if you tried"" and that would have been that. But she locked eyes with me and didn't say a fucking word, just turned and walked in the library. So... I steamed over it for the next 30 minutes. And when my wife came back to the car, I opened the car door for her.... hard. 3 times in quick succession. The SUVs door wasn't looking so pretty and shiny anymore. Wife got in and we drove away. I wish I could say I feel guilt over it, but I don't. Probably one of the most satisfied feelings I've ever had in my life. If something like that ever happened again, I don't think I'd react the same now. I have too much to lose these days. But damn was that a good feeling when it happened. Edit: Extra context since some of all seem to think I'm just misogynistic or something. My car was packed to the brim with everything I owned that I could fit in it. I was wedged in the middle of the backseat with no easy way out because I could only reach the wifi in the back seat. I'm a big fat guy in a teeny tiny car and it took me five minutes to crawl back in the front seat to get ready to leave lol. It was very obvious I was no threat to this lady and on top of that she had this ""I turn my nose up at you filthy peasant"" attitude as she walked away.",Ultimateace43,https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1hi19gj/i_purposefully_screwed_up_someones_car_door_in_a/
confession,My pants ripped while at work and everything bounced forth (self.confession),"I work as a courier between business and I was in a shipping dock picking up some heavy boxes. Now as I squated to pick one up my pants ripped at the back seam and ""everything"" flopped out at the peak of the squat. Now this wouldn't have been an issue had I not been fresh out of undergarments due to a laundry mistake. It was instantaneous. The loud and fast rip, the sudden drop and freedom of ""everything"" bouncing forth and the immediate crispness of the outside air on my hotdog and velvet purse. I immediately stood up to conceal the exposure and checked around but there was nobody there. I was still mortified. Tied my hoodie around my waist and eventually made my way to target to pick up some fresh pants.

confession,I changed a babys name of a mentally disabled woman (self.confession),"Please, let me explain. I used to be a volunteer with a certain org that works with disabled adults. I worked with a woman during her last trimester of pregnancy. She was diagnosed with Downs syndrome, significant. Nobody was sure how she got pregnant, but was pretty sure it was a family member. This young lady had been removed from the care of her family and was in the custody of a certain organization/state. Her baby was diagnosed in-utero with significant issues and was not going to live but a few hours after birth. We had discussed this with her several times, but wasn't sure if she really understood. She said she did, but did she? I was with her when the little girl was born. Of course the doctor was working on her, and the nurse asked what she wants to name her. The young lady said she heard the doctor say the ""most beautiful name ever"" and everyone on the room was confused. Apparently when the doctor was explaining to her what was happening to her body, he said you vagina may tear... All she heard was Vagina May. Yep. That's what she wanted to name the baby. When we tried to explain she couldn't, she became hysterical (not the time or place, baby was fading fast) so we calmed her and I said I'd handle it later. A few hours later, I'm helping her do the birth and death certificate as well as comforting her. Somehow, my finger slipped and I put an L in the place of the G in that baby's name. I felt horrible! I just couldn't bring myself to let that poor baby be named that on her headstone! The mother couldn't read or write. Her social worker took one look at the papers, did a deep sigh of relief and signed off on them, as did the doctor.

confession,I used to throw out food so my mom had to cook again (self.confession),"When I was a kid I used to live alone with my mother, she always cooked more than necessary at lunch so she don't need to cook again for dinner. Food usually was enough even for the next day lunch. I hated this, in my mind, there was no need for that. She was just lazy. I threw out the food so she had to cook a new one, this last for a month or so, obviously she realized what I was doing but never said a word, she just took the ""hint"" and cooked less.Looking back, she was so fucking busy.

confession,"We promised a sequel to our fans, and now we don't have the heart to deliver. (self.confession)","I’m an indie dev at a small studio. And quite a while back, we released a game that became way more popular than we could have ever imagined. It built an amazing, dedicated fanbase, something we’re incredibly grateful for. And obviously after that, we started working on a new project. We were excited, motivated, and full of ideas. That was years ago. We announced it back in Q1 2019. We were optimistic about development, but over time, things started to change. Feature creep took over. Burnout hit hard. Every time we thought we were close, we’d find something else that ""needed"" to be added or reworked. The passion we had in the beginning isn’t there anymore. And now, I don’t know if we even have it in us to make the game people expect. But how do you tell that to the fans? How do you say, “Hey, we know you’ve been waiting for years, but we just don’t have it in us anymore”? We’ve been radio silent because we don’t know how to break the news without disappointing everyone. I wish I could say we had an answer, but the truth is, we’re just stuck.

confession,"I stopped attending a class, lied about turning in a final and still passed.Light (self.confession)","I was reading through a few posts on this sub and found one that reminded me about a class I took in college. Back in my Junior year of College I took a class with a professor that I really did not like. He was so disorganized, absent minded and really didn't teach anything. The kind of professor that tells you to watch YouTube videos instead of actually teaching you the subject. It took him weeks to grade anything and I don't even think he read them. It seemed like he was just coasting until retirement. Anyway, I flew out to see my grandma one week for her 90th birthday. I missed a few classes and missed a few YouTube lessons. Well the following week my grandma passed so I flew back out for her funeral in turn missing a few more classes. I was really far behind and really had no clue what we were working on, flunked the midterm and missed a big project. At this point I just gave up and reserved myself to failure and retake it in the summer. Didn't show up to any other classes. At the end of the semester he emailed me regarding the final project and final test. He congratulated me on a great job with the group project. Really weird since I haven't been to class in months and was definitely not part of a group project. He was also wondering if I had turned in the final paper. I emailed him back and told him how happy I was that he enjoyed the project and I had definitely turned in my paper. Well I don't know if he wanted to cover his tracks and pretend he didn't lose my test or whether he didn't give a shit but when I checked my final grades for the semester, I had passed with a high C.

confession,I once faked having a twin brother for three months just to ghost a girl I didn’t know how to break up with. (self.confession),"I (29M) honestly don’t know why I’m thinking about this today, but it’s been eating at me for years. When I was about 23, I dated this girl I met at a party. She was super into me way faster than I expected. After two weeks, she was already talking about moving in, naming our future kids, getting matching tattoos — full speed ahead. I didn’t have the guts to just tell her it was too much. Instead of ending it like a normal person, I made the worst decision of my life: I pretended to die. Kinda. I created a fake Facebook profile pretending to be my “twin brother” (let’s call him “Jake”) and messaged her saying that I had tragically passed away in a “freak hiking accident.” I literally googled a photo of a random mountain and posted it like it was a memorial. She was devastated. I felt kind of bad… but also a little relieved. I thought that would be the end of it. Nope. She reached out to “Jake” constantly. At first it was condolences. Then it was weird things like, “I think you’re the only one who understands my pain,” and “Can we meet to mourn him together?” It got so bad that I had to fake “moving across the country for a fresh start” just to shut it down. I kept up the lie for THREE MONTHS before finally just deleting everything and disappearing. To this day, she probably still thinks I’m dead. Sometimes I wonder if karma is going to destroy me for it. Honestly, I deserve it.",xjcfbvfb,https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1k90wiw/i_once_faked_having_a_twin_brother_for_three/
confession,I took some Benadryl and it has forever completely changed me. (self.confession),"I should have known I’d end up here. What started as a way to sleep a little easier turned into something that’s taken over my life. I started taking Benadryl a while ago just to help knock me out. But over time, it stopped being about sleep. I started taking more. And more. I liked the way it made everything feel… distant. Like I could turn off my brain. I’ve talked about it before as some of you have read. I told myself I was in control. That I could stop whenever I wanted. But that was a lie. I’ve been hospitalized now. My body couldn’t keep up with what I was doing to it. I was hallucinating, disoriented, a shell of myself,hearing my dead mother, seeing the hat man, feeling trapped in my own skin. The doctors told me I was lucky to even make it in. Lucky. That word feels weird when you’re strapped to a hospital bed wondering what the hell you’ve done to yourself. Even now, even after everything, there’s still this part of me that wants to go back to it. It scares the hell out of me. I feel like I’ve rewired my brain and now I can’t find the way back to normal. I don’t even remember what normal feels like. I have no one to talk to. Maybe just to get it off my chest. Maybe because I feel like I’m screaming into a void and hoping someone hears me. I don’t want to be this person. I want out.

confession,Growing Up in a Polygamous Home: The Truth I Never Admitted (self.confession),"My family is very traditional. We are Fulani people from West Africa, and my dad has two wives—my mom is his second. In my culture, this is really common. And honestly, the wives hate each other. The same goes for my mom and stepmom. My mom lives in Africa, while I live in the U.S. with my dad and stepfamily. It’s not like a Cinderella story where they’re always bad—actually, they’re good most of the time. But every time a problem comes up, it’s always pointed out that I’m a stepsibling. My stepmom doesn’t really treat me as part of the family. In my Fulani household, it’s really common for older siblings to ask the younger ones to do things for them. It’s normal, and the younger ones can’t refuse. But every time my stepsisters ask me to do something, my stepmom will ask me for forgiveness as if I was wronged, telling me to forgive her and her family. She only does this to me. When I was between 13 and 15, she used to tell me things outright—like how I was a “spy” sent by my mother, that I didn’t see my stepsiblings as my family, and that I wanted to steal my sisters away from her son. She even accused me of trying to compete with her son at school, just because I was doing better than him. Shewould curse at me and make up things about me. One time, she didn’t just curse me—she cursed my mom too. That was when I finally got mad. But after everything, she suddenly started apologizing. Not because she actually meant it, but because she believes that if she doesn’t apologize, God will punish her. In Islam, when someone apologizes, you’re supposed to forgive them. But I didn’t forgive her. That made her even more upset. She escalated things, called my stepsiblings into the room, and one of my stepsisters physically beat me Edit: I honestly never expected this post to gain so much attention or even get any views. To me, all of this seemed normal, but I’m beginning to realize that it truly isn't. I'm incredibly grateful for all of your support. I’ve often felt isolated because of this situation, not sharing it with anyone out of fear that no one would understand, and because it's considered taboo to talk about it outside the family. At this point in my life, I’m 17 and have been living with my half-family since I was 11. I’ve come to realize that my greatest dream is to be in a safe, supportive environment where I can find peace of mind. I’m actively working on finding ways to escape this situation. I applied to the Ivy League, despite being told I wouldn't be able to get in because they offer full scholarships, and I’ll have to pay for my college no matter what. I hope that if I get in, it will provide me with a way to leave, and once I do, I never plan on coming back. I’ve been fortunate enough to get interviews from Harvard and Princeton (I really want to get into Princeton), but I understand that my chances are slim. I do have backup plans. If I don’t get in, I’ll try again as a transfer student. Right now, I’m focused on building my startup (my family doesn’t know, but I want to be an entrepreneur). I’m currently working on my first venture and in the process of looking for a co-founder. It’s been challenging and there have been a lot of disappointments along the way, but I won’t give up on my idea. I’ve validated it through 143 surveys with my target audience, and 94% of them are interested in it. If I get rejected and have to try again as a transfer student, I’ll mention my startup in hopes that it might increase my chances. If that doesn’t work out, I’ll figure out another way, but one thing I know for sure is that I will find a way to escape. I’ve also decided to make more posts on r/Confession about different things that have happened in my life. Seeing things from the outside, I realize just how toxic my situation is. I’ve made it a mission to write about polygamy in the hopes of raising awareness and, if nothing else, helping at least one person who might be going through something similar. Thank you so much for all your support. I plan to update this post on March 26th to let you know if I got into an Ivy League school. I’ve done my best, and if I don’t get in, that’s okay, but I’m really hoping I do. I’ve posted my articles on a few platforms, and I intend to go into more detail on each. Writing is my way of coping; when I understand something, its power over me diminishes. I also like to use all the knowledge I’ve gained from self-help books to help others understand deeper issues. Here are the places where I’ve posted my articles, which explain more about my experiences growing up in a polygamous household. https://open.substack.com/pub/blackpen8/p/breaking-the-silence-the-quiet-struggles?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android&r=3g2srf https://medium.com/@bintadiallo7287/breaking-the-silence-the-quiet-struggles-of-a-child-in-a-polygamous-household-011e2ea87d2a ) Follow me there as I will go more in depth about thing I have not mensioned in here.

confession,I almost killed myself yesterdayConflicted (self.confession),"I prepared pretty much everything and have been planning so for the past several months. I live alone and often busy with work and school which is mostly done at home. My parents are thousands of miles away from me. Constantly isolating myself till I feel like I'm forgotten just so things can be easier, less of a hassle, y'know. Finding solace in random strangers and feeling a temporary sense of gratification just to get by i suppose. All if it just feels so...numb and empty. So I grabbed my cat, gave him to my neighbor, told him Ill be out for a few hours. Went back to my unit, tied a noose right by the already set up hook near my window. Took a plastic chair. Slid my head inside the rope. And then a knock. It was my neighbor. It was just an hour in since I gave my cat over, he was knocking furiously and shouting that i had to get him back. I hid my setup and cleaned up, hurried towards the door. He had scratches all over his arms and a big ass scab right across the left side of his cheek. My cat apparently started acting up, crying super loudly and was scratching furiously at the door out of nowhere. I apologized and asked if he wanted help with his wounds but he declined. I went back in and decided to sleep it off. Update: The amount of support and love I've been receiving is honestly surprising and overwhelming and I thank every single one of you guys who made the effort to send me a message or comment their experiences and support, I promise that I'll reply to every single one. I had absolutely no intention for this post to boom, I really just wanted to get this off my chest and even now everything just feels like a blurry mess I'm not sure if I'm even actually making any sense at all. And to clear things up I'm unsure how my post history has any connection to the confession above. I live in a completely different time zone (the Philippines) from the (im assuming) majority of the people on here and idk I just seriously don't have the energy to try and defend myself at this point. I do realize that I am actually quite privileged. But of course before pulling the ""I'm suffering way more than you, suck it up you ungrateful cunt"" card on me. Do realize that every single person's hardships are valid and not all individuals are alike. We have different levels of emotional capacity/stability/whatever. I'm sorry life's been hard on you but that's not a free pass to invalidate someone elses experiences. What you know might only be what you see or what you've been shown on the surface. I'd like the thank the redditor who gave this post a Reddit Gold, truly appreciated. And also, for fellow suicide survivors, thank you for sharing your stories, thoughts and insights. I feel like I'm not expressing the gratitude that I feel as much as I think I should and I wish everything in my head were more concrete and I apologize.",,https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/7ver9n/i_almost_killed_myself_yesterday/
confession,I don't have any positive emotions towards my child (self.confession),"I've never wanted kids. Even my younger cousins or when I had a baby sibling while being late in my teens I've never found them cute or even wanted to interact with them. My wife got pregnant and because I know they're my responsibility and because I'm not an awful person I need to stick around and provide for them both. But I just can't say I love him. I don't think I hate or dislike my son by any means but I know I don't love him. I hate when he cries when I'm sleeping and I just immediately get upset everytime he cries. I never act out or get aggressive with him though. I hate ""bath time"" and ""tummy time"". I just don't want to be a father in general and it's really upsetting I guess that it won't really get any easier from here. I've always been more selfish with my own time and money and no I have very little of both because I have to take care of him. I hate having to creep around my own house when he's sleeping, I hate the near constant crying, I hate diaper changes, I don't even really like holding him. I still do my part in taking care of him and my wife thinks I'm a great husband and father because I do what's needed of me and take care of them both and I know I'm awful for feeling this way but I guess I needed someone to tell because it's kind of eating me up inside. I don't know what to do about this. I know it sounds like I'm whiney and immature and maybe I am but this is just how I feel inside.

confession,I mercilessly bullied 5 people in high school. 3/5 of them killed themselves.Remorse (self.confession),"I am in my 40s now, and I don't deserve the life I have. I stepped on the backs of my classmates to make myself feel better about myself. I was bullied harshly in school, and had the shit beat out of me on a daily basis until I hit puberty. Then I suddenly grew into a monster. I towered over everybody at school. I also channeled my anger into working out, and became even bigger. I was a huge, ogre of a person. I hated EVERYBODY. I had so much angst built up from my own bullying. My former bullies, being the manipulative cowards that they were (I see this in retrospect, but didn't see it at the time), befriended me. And we pretty much held a reign of terror over the school. I fed on the newfound respect from my former enemies. We preyed on the weak. There were about 5 nerds that I personally tormented harshly. I joined facebook a couple months ago to see what became of them. I had hopes that they were able to live happy lives despite my awful treatment of them. One I knew died suspiciously in high school, but it turns out it was a suicide that was covered up. Two more killed themselves right after high school graduation. The 4th lives alone in a trailer and appears to be crazy. The 5th person actually turned their life around and married the head cheerleader several years after graduation. So at least there's that. I wish I could apologize to the remaining two, but it would be so trite and meaningless. Plus, it would probably re-traumatize them, having to see me again, or having to think about those events again. I suck, I'm sorry, and sometimes I feel like I should off myself too. You know, to balance the scales of life. I have been tormented my entire adult life for being the bully that I was, when I really should have been an advocate for the bullied instead. I mean, I already knew how it felt! Instead of sticking up for people and beating the bullies asses, I, like a bitch, joined them.

I love making my friends laugh with my various sexual exploits, especially the ones that make me look like an idiot. However, I have never told anybody this. I was in a situationship with this girl from Donegal. She was an absolute FREAK. Loves everything and anything you can imagine EXCEPT P in the V. Some religious bollocks. I literally fucked this girl in the arse, elbow, knee, mouth, feet, just no P in V. Anyway, we went home for the summer and on day one when I came back in second year we bumped into each other. Few drinks, quick catch up and before you know it we're back at mine. I'm going down on her and slightly confused. I could normally make her cum within a few minutes with oral but I'm doing all my usual stuff and she's barely reacting. Next thing, humiliations of all humiliations she says ""it's fine, just fuck me."" I felt like an awful failure but when I pulled my head back I realised I wasn't licking her clit, I was licking......a genital wart!!!!!!

confession,I posted fake jobs on internet so I could build my own resume (self.confession),"When i was 19-20 years old I was looking for jobs and could not find any and people would tell me to build a nice resume. The problem was, I did not know how to do it so I posted fake jobs on internet and would get resumes. I used those resumes to build my own using the skills that I liked on their resumes. I could also tell who was competing with me for those jobs that I posted. I feel bad for those people that thought it was genuine and applied. I am 33 now and have a nice job. Those resumes truly did help me build my career. EDIT: THANKS FOR ALL THE LIKES AND COMMENTS FRIENDS. MANY OF YOU SAID A LOT OF POSITIVE THINGS TO ME THAT I HAD NOT THOUGHT OF MYSELF. PEOPLE THAT HAVE SAID WHY ARE OTHER PEOPLE CONDONING THIS, PLEASE GET THIS THAT I WAS ONLY 19 WEN THIS HAPPENED AND I DIDNT KNOW ANY BETTER. I WAS ONLY LOOKING TO WORK AND MAKE MONEY BY WORKING HARD. THATS ALL. THANKA FOR THE AWARD! BLESS YOU ALL! 2nd EDIT : SOME PEOPLE MESSAGED ME ASKING FOR RESUME BUILDING TIPS. BIGGEST TIP I CAN GIVE TO SOMEONE IS; READ THE JOB DESCRIPTION OF THE JOB YOU ARE APPLYING FOR, THEN INCORPORATE KEYWORDS FROM THAT DESCRIPTION INTO YOUR OWN SKILL SET OF PREVIOUS JOBS. THAT HELPS A LOT! 3rd EDIT : some people asked me if I had somewhat similar confessions to make from my life. When I was in grade 2, I would show an empty box to my classmates and tell them there's invisible powder in there. I would charge them their lunch money for it. I would pretend I was scooping out some powder and hand it to them.",mapleleafsf4n,https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/mlfzzd/i_posted_fake_jobs_on_internet_so_i_could_build/
confession,I cheated on my husband with a married man. Which resulted in the break up of both our marriage.Support Only (self.confession),"Well long story short, I was in a horrible marriage with my alcoholic husband. He was hanging out with swingers and got a drunken blow job while he was stationed in Korea (I was back home in America). At some point he said things to me that broke my heart into pieces. So I went alone to prove to my self I am worthy of appreciation from a man. Found a man and he was married and in a failing marriage. They had not have sex in 2 years and were sleeping in different beds. I just wanted a male friend to appreciate me. But we ended up falling in love. Of course we carried on with the affair. And of course a spouse got suspicious and had a falling out and it contributed to the break up of the marriage. I fell completely out of love with my husband before even started the affair. Once I met a new man there was no turning back. It is about to be 3 years that we been together, and he has been one of the best thing that has happened in my life. We are soulmates, bestfriends. I can't tell anyone this story, but I had to confess.",throwaway74OP,https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/9k6620/i_cheated_on_my_husband_with_a_married_man_which/

confession,I called CPS on my daughter and she is facing losing custody of her baby.Conflicted (self.confession),"For context, my daughter is 15 years old. She has been living in my house with her 2 month old son since he was born, and I recently reported her to child services. She has a case opened and the case manager is on the verge of recommending removal (several factors at play). When she first told me she was pregnant I told her she either got an abortion, gave the baby up for adoption, or she could have the baby but I would give her nothing but what I am legally required to. She had only recently started high school, and I will be the first to admit I took the news exceptionally hard. I was scared out of my mind for her. My wife had always kept things open and told me she’d taken her to our local health department to talk about birth control (our daughter opted out and her doctor was in support) so we got her a large bag of condoms in the event she were to choose to become sexually active. She was prepared, she had the knowledge, she refused the birth control and ended up pregnant. Honestly, we couldn’t even afford to support her and the baby if we wanted to. My wife hasn’t worked since 2011 and her disability hardly makes a dent in our expenses. We finally had to downsize our home and sell my wife’s car just a few months before my daughter announced her pregnancy. I was working hours that just weren’t sustainable and my wife needed me to help her at home. About 5 months into the pregnancy (my daughter insisted on raising the baby) her boyfriend moved away to live with family in another state and didn’t tell her. She found out when the relatives made a post on social media about how excited they were he was there and then she was slowly blocked by the rest of the family. She hasn’t heard from him since, he has never met his son and the family has never reached out. I told my daughter when she refused to abort that I would in no uncertain terms support her child, that I would love and treat them like a grandparent is expected to but I would not be financially responsible for it’s care or keeping and if she could not find a way to provide, I would call the appropriate authorities to intervene. She dropped out but only got a part time job, was unmotivated to get her GED or diploma through adult ed (I actually offered to pay for her class fee and test fees) and expected that my wife would take care of the baby while she was at work. She would often forget and miss a feed, refused to pump milk regularly and got a major breast infection, would often delay changing to save money on diapers, it was not a good situation. My wife and I of course were there behind her and have been using formula and making sure he was getting nutrients, but my daughter was not nurturing this child in any competent manner and while not malicious, was often neglectful of the baby. It wasn’t easy to make the call, but it was necessary and something I had long prepared to do. My daughter hates me, my wife is empathetic but has stood by my decision from the start, and I am both uncertain and at peace with my choices. Part of me feels like I did the best I could for everyone involved and part of me knows I betrayed my daughter on a horrible way and part of me knows that this baby deserves better than what she ( and really we) could provide. Edit: I did not realize that this would blow up over night. I would like to clarify a few things, though. I did not ever allow that baby to suffer. I did say my wife and I were going behind her with formula to make sure he was gaining his weight back, I didn’t think I’d have to also clarify that we did indeed supply more diapers when we realized what she was doing. Also, we have not neglected our daughter nor have we treated her to such cold indignities like neglecting her medical care. We did get her infection treated promptly, she had prenatal and postnatal care. Contrary to what most people believe, I am not doing this out of anger. I am sad for my daughter and deeply disappointed that this is what life has come to but we cannot afford to raise her and a baby. I made this incredibly clear to her, and told her the consequences of her inability to provide once the baby got here would be child service involvement. We have not allowed either our daughter or her baby to wallow in filth or suffer, but we will not continue to provide the care for her infant, and so I had to call the only people I knew who would help. I won’t pretend that I have made all the best choices or that I am perfect, but I am not heartless or abusive.",mixedemotional,https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/aihge7/i_called_cps_on_my_daughter_and_she_is_facing/
confession,I straight-up lied to children for YEARS just to avoid an uncomfortable joke (self.confession),"I taught Latin chant for a few years at a posh Catholic middle school. My first semester there was rough as I was a fresh music teacher out of college and really didn't know how to handle 8th grade boys. One of the first chants the priest asked me to teach was ""Panis Angelicus"" and I died internally because I KNEW those 8th grade boys were going to make penis jokes given how close ""panis"" was to ""penis"" ...and I had no idea how to handle it without blushing myself (I know, I know - I'm a much more seasoned teacher now!). So I lied and taught them via rote (""repeat after me"") not letting them see the words for weeks, pronouncing it without the ""s"" so it was just ""pani"" ...and then when I finally handed out the music, I mentioned very casually off hand that some words in Latin don't pronounce the ""s"" at the end, now are you ready?, 1 2 3 sing! When we performed it (with the sheet music in front of them, another strategic choice), inevitably a couple kids accidentally added the ""s"" in, creating the illusion of correct pronunciation. 100% would do again.",Obvious_Firefox,https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1ld1g1x/i_straightup_lied_to_children_for_years_just_to/

confession,When I was 9 I started the biggest fire my town had seen in 150 years. (self.confession),"When I was 9 my older cousin (14) stayed with me and my family for a couple weeks. My cousin was a troublemaker and her parents had hoped that sending her to ours would keep her out of trouble for a little while. One day while she was over I asked if we could go to one of our local forest areas and make a fire to roast marshmallows. When we got down there we made a little makeshift campfire out of newpaper and sticks all on top a rock. Eventually my curiosity got the better of me and I started chucking different things into the fire. Leaves, sticks, pinecones, anything I could find in the little area we were in. Then I wondered what a leaf on a tree would do if we set fire to it. My cousin got her lighter and lit a small leaf on a near by tree. I stared at the reaction in awe and my cousin set a group of leaves on fire. We laughed as we watched the fire slowly engulf the branch. Once the fire burnt itself out we carried on setting fire to bushes and branches and then we realised that the fire wasn't dying out. In fact it spreading. My cousin started to freak out as she realised the fire wasn't stopping. The summer heatwave had made everything so dry that it was catching fire extreamly quickly. She grabbed my hand and we ran to the dirt road that was on the outskirts to the forest. But instead of calling 999 we just stood there. Watching it as it spread and spread and spread. My cousin almost called them multiple times but I kept telling her I didn't want to get into trouble so she never did. It had eventually spread so much that the fire department had trouble controlling it and had to order an evacuation of a nearby village. It was said to be the biggest fire the town had seen in 150 years. No one was hurt but it did take 10 hours to get under control. It wouldn't have been as bad if hadn't stopped my cousin calling 999 when we first lost control. Both I and my cousin had promised not to tell a soul but 12 years on and my guilt is still here, I still feel terrible about it. EDIT: Ok I think now is a good time to do an edit for extra info that I think needs to be said. Firstly, I am female. Secondly, as a kid I was emotionally abused. My parents had a God at me for very small things like leaving a cup out instead of putting it in the sink. And I mean my mum use to call me useless and a worthless idiot at least three times a day. It wasn't until my cousin came to visit that I was allowed to leave my house with out an adult (even though a lot of kids could play in the park and go out on bikes ect). My aunt thought my parents 'strict' nature would pull her into shape. I was always seen as a 'good kid' when in actuality I was just submissive and did as I was told. Lastly, the reason I won't tell the authorities the truth is that I have a very, let's say comfortable, job. The sort of job that holds all its employees to a very high standard. I have my own place. I have holidays booked for the future. I have a wonderful boyfriend who I love dearly and is helping me lose my submissive programing. If I was let slip that I had been the cause of one of the biggest fires our town has ever seen then I'd loose, almost, everything. I have been stressing and dealing with anxiety my whole life. I put it here in hopes that it would lift a portion of the guilt and anxiety I have harboured for 10+ years. Thank you to everyone who has said kind words to me I really appreciate it. Also thank you to everyone who has made jokes about it all. I have never laughed as much as I have today. Thank you.",anonymouspossum99,https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/hex7ud/when_i_was_9_i_started_the_biggest_fire_my_town/
confession,I choked out an 8th grader 13 years ago (self.confession),"Some background info needed. I come from a mixed race Muslim family and grew up in a small post-9/11 midwestern town so there was a lot of bullying towards me and my siblings. Durring a school football game my younger brother was watching, one of the guys that bullied us, lets call him Chad (who was in the same grade as me), threw a water bottle at my lil bros face. My brother (a 7th grader) had to walk home with a swollen eye and my mom had to put ice on it to get the swelling to go down. He wouldn't tell her who did it but he told me. This fliped a switch in my head. My brother was a bullied a lot more than me on account he was younger, slightly effeminate and had dark skin like our father. Meanwhile I was a year older, tall for my age and white like my mom so I didn't have it close as bad as him. Anyway. Chad would leave school out one of the back exits to save time on his walk home. I knew nobody else left that way so when school got out the next Monday I followed him. I ran after him and started chocking him from behind like I had seen in action movies. Maybe it was because of the adrenalin but I started screaming all kinds of crap at him. The cliche ""dont mess with my family"" stuff. I left him unconscious behind the school and went home. This was the first and last time I used violence against someone. I never told anyone and neither did he so I wasn't punished for this. Chad turned up to school the next day and everything was back to normal. The only thing that changed was that Chad and his friends stopped harassing me and my bro. To this day I still think he had it coming. Edit: if I'm being honest while I was choking Chad and screaming at him I was also balling my eyes out. Yea...fighting didn't suit me Edit 2: I was the same age as the other kid.

TrueOffMyChest,I thought my boyfriend had a c*ckold kink. Turns out he was secretly dating a man the entire time (self.TrueOffMyChest),"I (23F) have been sitting with this for a while now, not really sure if I should post, but honestly, I just need to let it out. I dated this guy (24M), we’ll call him J, for about seven months. On the surface, everything looked fine at first, but now that I’ve had time to process, I realize how off things felt from the beginning. J was really charming when we met. Not fake charming either, at least not at first. He complimented me a lot, made it very clear he was into me. He’d text all the time, constantly wanted to hang out, and just seemed really enthusiastic about the relationship. It felt a little intense, but I had just come out of a long period of being single, and I guess I appreciated the attention. I thought maybe this time I had met someone who genuinely liked me and wasn’t afraid to show it. We got together pretty quickly after meeting. The first couple of months were fine. Nothing extraordinary, but he said all the right things, met my friends, did little things like bring me snacks at work or text good morning and good night. He seemed sweet and thoughtful. The only thing that didn’t feel quite right was our sex life. Around month three or four, I started to feel like I was the only one trying. He didn’t initiate anything, and even when I did, he barely responded. He would zone out, or things would just fizzle. It felt awkward and one-sided. I didn’t want to push or make him feel uncomfortable, so I asked if everything was okay. That’s when he told me he had a kink. Specifically, a c*ckold kink. He said he was really into the idea of watching his partner sleep with other men. At first, I didn’t know how to react. I thought maybe he was joking or testing my boundaries, but he was completely serious. He assured me it wasn’t because he wasn’t attracted to me, and that he just wanted to explore this side of himself. He emphasized that he didn’t want to cheat, that this would be consensual and open. I’d never done anything like that before, but I didn’t want to shame him for being honest. After sitting with it for a few days, I told him I was open to trying it once to see how I felt. That’s when he introduced me to D (25M). He said D was a friend from the gym, someone he trusted, who knew about his kink and was cool with it. It was incredibly awkward at first, but D was surprisingly respectful. He didn’t make things weird or gross, and he made sure I was okay the entire time. We ended up sleeping together while J watched. To my surprise, J seemed really into it. It caught me off guard, but I told myself that this was his kink, and we were being safe, honest, and communicative. If he was happy and I didn’t feel disrespected, then maybe it wasn’t such a big deal. This arrangement went on for the next couple of months. D and I were sleeping together regularly while J watched. And somewhere along the line, D and I started developing a friends-with-benefits relationship. We would talk before and after, sometimes hang out on our own, grab food, send each other memes. He was emotionally present in a way J never really was. J mostly just sat back and watched. He rarely joined in, even when I tried to include him. Then, one day, D texted me and asked if we could meet in person. I assumed he was done with the setup and wanted out. Instead, when we met up, he told me something that flipped my world upside down. D said something along the lines of, “I don’t know how to tell you this, but I think J is cheating on you.” He added, “And not with a woman. With a man.” He explained that over the past few weeks, J had been confiding in him, getting weirdly emotional, and saying things that didn’t make sense if I was actually his main partner. J had confessed to D that he was in love with him. Not me - him. D said J was only turned on during our sessions because he was watching him, not because I was involved. The entire arrangement was a setup to get closer to D in a way that felt “safe” and justifiable. But that’s not even the worst part. D told me J had been in a relationship with another man the entire time he was dating me. They had been seeing each other even before I came into the picture. And J had been emotionally cheating on his boyfriend by watching and getting off to D sleeping with me. He told D that he wanted to come out, but didn’t feel ready, and that dating me made it easier to keep up appearances. His family is very conservative and religious, so I was, apparently, the straight-girlfriend mask he wore to stay safe. I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. So I did something that honestly made my heart drop, I contacted the boyfriend. I found his Instagram through J’s following list and sent a message. I tried to be respectful and not accusatory. I just told him who I was, how long I’d been dating J, and asked if he’d been seeing him too. He replied the next day. He said yes, they had been in an on-and-off relationship for over a year. He admitted that he knew about me. J told him everything, but framed it like I was in on it, that we were in some kind of poly situation. He thought I knew the whole time and was totally cool with it. I don’t even know how to describe how that made me feel. Like I was being lied to from every direction. I had no idea. I thought I was in a monogamous relationship, trying to be a supportive girlfriend, trying to be sexually open for someone I cared about. But I was just the cover for a man who couldn’t admit who he was, and who was emotionally and physically cheating on two people while pretending like it was all consensual. I broke up with J over text. I didn’t want to see him. I didn’t want him to talk his way out of it or explain. I blocked him on everything. I heard through mutual friends that he ended up leaving town a few weeks later. I haven’t spoken to him since. D and I are still in touch, but things aren’t the same. We’re both a little shaken up by it. I don’t blame him for any of it - he was manipulated, too - but I think we both just needed space to sort out what had happened. The betrayal hit in layers. It wasn’t just the lie. It was the manipulation, the emotional harm, the use of people as props in a life he couldn’t admit to living. I’ve been going to therapy, which helps, but I still have days where I feel used, and honestly, stupid. The worst part is, I wouldn’t have cared if he was gay or bi. If he had just said it, we could’ve talked about it. But he chose to lie, involve people without their consent, and use me like a mask he could hide behind. I’m slowly learning to trust myself again. To forgive myself for not seeing it sooner. To draw better boundaries and recognize red flags when they show up. It still hurts, but I’m healing. Thanks for reading this.

TrueOffMyChest,I faked killing spider for years and my Mom has no idea (self.TrueOffMyChest),"Now, for context, my Mom has a deep fear of spiders, to the point where she is too scared to kill them herself. So basically I have always been the one who has to deal with the spiders. But when I was maybe 11 or 12 I decided my Mother had to face her fear. For some reason, I fully believed that she had to remove these spiders herself to grow as a person. Another thing is my family lived in this old house out in the middle of the country. And if you’ve been in an old building in mid spring you can understand the amount of bugs invading the premises. So on that day, my Mom comes running screaming out of her room, telling me that she needs a hand getting the hellspawn out of her room. I straight up tell her I can’t help, and in a panic, my sweet Mother bargains herself a child exterminator. As in, I get paid one dollar for every spider I kill. Obviously, I march in there full of bravado, do the dirty work, and receive my pay in full. Anywho, my Mother refuses to have spiders done away with inside her house. So typically I would jar the spiders and take them outside to receive a deadly smackdown with my sister’s flip-flops. That day, however, I had a different plan. In my young business-centred mind I thought it would be a great idea to TAXIDERMY THE SPIDER. Sparing the brutal details I essentially hid the spider in our freezer (still in the jar, of course). Then, after it became frozen permanently, I arranged it with some tweezers, and hair sprayed the thing into place. And here is the real confession; I hid that thing in my mom's house for years. I’ve collected so many dollars from that spider, and I feel terrible. I have unlawfully caused my poor Mom so much fear over some DIY taxidermy. I stopped doing this long ago when David (as I christened the spider) lost a good chunk of his legs. But I still feel so bad, I want to tell my Mom but I’m kind of scared she would be livid over this. Spiders are not a joking matter in my household and if I tell her that years ago I was scamming her like this I think she might just stop talking to me.",LoafChild,https://old.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1lhai3o/i_faked_killing_spider_for_years_and_my_mom_has/
TrueOffMyChest,My husband of 15 years has been hooking up with trans escorts… and I don’t even know who he is anymore (self.TrueOffMyChest),"We’ve been together since we were 17, high school sweethearts. We were each other’s firsts: first kiss, first love, first real relationship. We basically grew up side by side. We got married at 23, had our first daughter a few years later, and now we have two girls, one is 13 and the other is 8. Openness was the core of our relationship. Even through tough times, like those early years of parenting or when money got tight, we always talked things through. I thought we had something rare, imperfect but real, deep, and safe. That’s why this pain feels so unbearable and confusing. Not long ago, I discovered he’s been seeing trans escorts. I wasn’t looking for anything; he just fell asleep with his phone unlocked and a notification popped up that made my heart drop. What came next was a flood of messages, photos, appointment details, and payment records. It was like I was reading about someone I never knew, a side of him I never imagined existed. Of course, I confronted him. He broke down and said he’s been struggling with confusion, that it’s not about me, that he still loves me and wants to keep our family together. He said he didn’t know how to talk to me about it. But how am I supposed to believe that when he kept something so big hidden from me for, I don’t even know how long? Some messages go back over a year. I don’t know who he is anymore. Just saying that breaks me. This man has been my whole life. I’ve never been with anyone else. We built everything, family, home, memories. I thought I knew him better than anyone. Now when I look at him, I feel like I’m staring at a stranger. I keep asking myself how many other parts of him are secrets. How long he’s been feeling this way. Why he couldn’t trust me enough to be honest or why he chose to lie instead. I’m trying to stay strong for the girls. They don’t know and I want to keep their world calm. But inside, I’m falling apart. I cry when I’m alone. I don’t have much appetite or sleep. I replay our whole relationship in my mind, searching for when things changed. But everything always seemed normal or at least I thought it was. I haven’t told anyone. Saying it aloud would make it too real. I just needed to put this out somewhere safe where I can be honest. Because right now, I don’t know what to do.

I loved him deeply, but I realize how lonely I've been for a long time. Even now, I feel lonely even when we are together. We managed our LDR situation for so long and we could only meet when one has a long vacation or holiday (mostly on Decembers). Whenever we argued, he would ignore, and I was always the one to say sorry. He would go to sleep, ignoring me, ignoring my feelings and everything. I always felt like I had to chase him just to keep this relationship going. I could never share my complains or feelings because he will get annoyed, saying, I just keep complaining, when I was just seeking comfort. So, I've been trying to keep my feelings for myself. I always have to becareful what I share incase he feels I am complaining again. He can ignore me for how long he feel like it. He goes to sleep while I cry my hearts out anxiously waiting for his reply. How stupid I feel from those times. Even now, I am waiting for him to message back. How low and pathetic I feel about myself. Recently, he casually said, if someday he decides to become a missionary and if I didn’t want that kind of life, I should find someone else. Just like that, like the 7 years we had were nothing. I had no complains if he really wants to become one. But for him to casually say ""You should just go find someone else"". I don’t know how I should reply. But, as always, I need to becareful with my words or else we will have another argument. And now, just because I let my guard down, I shared how I just helped my parents and brother. My mom pressuring me for money, we are poor, we have debt, I understand where my mom is coming from, sometimes it was too much, and she was asking if I can get a laptop for my brother, so I looked for ways, and decided to pay it using credit. My brother was in his 3rd year in college, he never really asked for anything and we are in a good relationship so I helped him. But, bf wasn't amazed. Instead, he just commented how bad I am with money, why I paid with credit, why my parents didn't buy it instead for my brother. Since I am not good with money, he threatened he will not marry me because I'll make him bankrupt. I never asked him to pay. I am doing my best for myself, my future and my family. I am trying to help with the little I have. He dare say, how can you save money now. How can you travel with me. How can we live together. You always give to your parents. Just keep giving them, I'll be far and you won't have money to come to me. I was insulted. I am trying my best to help my family but still have something left for me to use and save. I managed that. He wouldn't listen. And just insulted me for helping my family.",Ordinary-Milk-2693,https://old.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1lgwp0u/my_bf_said_he_wont_marry_me_because_i_helped_my/

I was bragging about him doing something within his hobby that I was genuinely proud of him for. Then a dude who had been lowkey checking me out all night looked him in his face and goes “so what things from her hobbies have you been celebrating?” While it did make me feel not great to hear him say “honestly I don’t know.”, it was very validating to hear another dude call him out on lowkey being a dick to me. Lately he’s been acting like I’m torturing him just for asking him to go to a movie that he doesn’t like, and I’ve kinda felt like the amount of interest in each other’s hobbies hasn’t been equal for a while, but it felt nice for another dude to clock it.",Unique_Pool6730,https://old.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1lhi2te/went_to_a_swingers_club_and_a_guy_gave_my_bf_a/
TrueOffMyChest,Kids literally made everything about the relationship worse (self.TrueOffMyChest),"In before: the kids were between 6 and 12 years old. A few years ago, I met an amazing woman. We fell for each other quicky. She had multiple kids from a previous relationship, which normally would´ve been a hard no for me, but I guess I liked her so much that I thought ""You know what, maybe I can handle it. Maybe I´ll grow into it"". Spoiler: I didnt. No matter how hard I tried, I never felt like I was dating a partner, just a mom. And yeah, maybe I should´ve expected that. But it still hit me harder than I thought. Every idea I had of what a relationship should be, just the two of us, building something together, it didnt happen. Want to go on a vacation? Only if the kids come too. Want to go swimming together at sunset? Forget it, we´ve got the kids yelling at each other poolside. Go camping? Sure, but dont expect sleep, because a kid´s probably going to wake you up at 3am scared of monsters. We did one ""real"" vacation, got two hotel rooms, one for us, one for the kids. Not once did we actually sleep alone together, because every night, one of the kids had a meltdown or insisted on sleeping in her bed. These are kids between 6 and 12, not toddlers. It got frustrating. Meanwhile, my friends were going to festivals, taking couple trips, living the ""young adult"" life. I was spending weekends at playgrounds and playing referee to Roblox arguments. And when we did get a rare moment alone? It was always interrupted. One of the kids would barge in mid-conversation, mid hug, mid-anything, just to show us something random, an ant they found outside, a YouTube video, whatever. I know they are just being kids, but it was nonstop. It was exhausting. And honestly? Boring. I missed feeling like I was in an adult relationship. Like we could just be together without constant chaos. To be 100% clear, I dont blame my ex at all. She was doing what any good mom should. This was my mistake. I chose to step into a situation I clearly wasnt built for. But I wont pretend it didnt wear me down. There was never really ""alone time"". It was always about the kids, every day, every weekend, every vacation. And yeah, they could be seriously annoying. Im not here to trash on her or the kids. Im just saying, for me? It didnt work. I couldnt do it. And I wish I´d been honest with myself way earlier. So yeah, thats the end. Now you can call me the devil.",squid456-,https://old.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1lh3g4j/kids_literally_made_everything_about_the/
TrueOffMyChest,Gym crushes are basically my motivator (self.TrueOffMyChest),"I’ve recently started an active gym routine at an inexpensive but quality establishment filled with a wide range of folks. I’m in my early forties, married happily, have kids. Dad bod for days, and I’m pretty over weight, and definitely not looking for anyone or anything. But I get enormous joy from little gym crushes. There are just some beautiful and fit people in there clearly working hard and it is paying off and it’s impossible to not notice. I try very hard not to be a creep about this, I don’t stare or ever make eye contact, but I notice them and double or maybe triple take and it’s just like “damn” and it’s motivating for me to get my body back to a place where I’m more positive about myself, back to being a contender even if just for the endorphins. My wife and I are pretty open about these things and joke about it, but I am conflicted some days about how to feel about it. On the one hand these people are super fit and wearing very tight clothing that shows this, I am happy for them and for me? On the other hand I also consider myself a feminist and hate the idea of objectifying people. But I just have to admit somewhere that this is a thing I feel, and expect a range of responses to this.",ProlapsedMorals,https://old.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1lh5lra/gym_crushes_are_basically_my_motivator/
TrueOffMyChest,He never had to lose me. He just never deserved me. (self.TrueOffMyChest),"We were married on April 10, 2014. That’s 11 years, 2 months, and 11 days. You missed 7 of my birthdays, 6 anniversaries, 5 Valentine’s Days, our oldest daughter’s birth, 5 of her birthdays, 3 of our second child’s birthdays, 1 Christmas, 4 Thanksgivings, 6 Mother’s Days, 6 New Year’s, 3 Halloweens, and 5 Easters. We been married 11 years.. you do the math. You missed the countless prenatal appointments. The ultrasounds. You were gone at different points during all three of my pregnancies while I carried your children in different states, without family, without support while you chased your career… and cheated. This past Christmas the one time you were actually home you gave me the gift of a yeast infection and GBS. You watched me suffer. You watched me get on medication and question my own health and mental state. I had to pry it out of you. You let me carry the weight of your betrayal in my own body for months. You cheated on me while my dad was dying. And this year for the first time you weren’t gone. You were just mad. So instead of showing up for my birthday or Mother’s Day, you chose to ignore me and sent messages telling me I was a bad mother and that everyone would be better off if I were dead. And still, I showed up. That’s who I’ve always been. You never had to lose me. You just never deserved me. And the wildest part? After all that, you still act like I’m the one who wronged you. You knew the dysfunctional family I came from. You knew my family dynamic. You married me anyway and later used it as ammo to paint me as the problem. You took my trauma and turned it into your defense. You hurt me the most when I was already at my lowest. When the one person I was closest to…my dad…was dying, you knew I needed you. And instead of being there, you punished me for it. Even then I showed you grace. I loved you through everything. Every fiber in my being forgave you and loved you through your worst moments...In the end though I don’t regret any of it because I know you needed my love more than I ever needed yours. I know one day the ache of my absence will hit you.

TrueOffMyChest,My best friend moved in with me and it's making me hate her. (self.TrueOffMyChest),"(Reposting bc the first one got removed before I read the rules, sorry mods) About two years ago my best friend got out of a bad relationship and asked to move in with me, since my unit is a two bedroom. I didn't want a roommate, but her ex made sure she was financially dependent on him and she had nowhere else to go. The only reason I agreed to let her move in was because she said she'd be giving me $100-200 a month to help with rent until she found a job. Fast forward to today, she's only given me money for rent ONCE, when she first moved in, plus she still has no job. She uses my good cookware and lets it sit in the sink filled with water for days or weeks at a time before washing them, and when she does wash things or run the dishwasher, nothing ever gets put away unless I do it myself. It's gotten to the point that I get annoyed to be around her while I'm at home.

TrueOffMyChest,Our dog is in kidney failure and we’re going to have to put him down. Our kids are wrecked and it’s breaking my heart. (self.TrueOffMyChest),"We have two fantastic dogs my wife and I adopted from our local shelter a few days after moving into our house. They were both about a year and a half old at the time and have been incredible companions ever since. They’ve seen so many firsts in our family including the birth of our two children and have been the goodest dogs you could imagine with them as they grew up. Now they’re both 12 and, unfortunately, one of them is nearing the end. His name is Tucker. He’s a beagle/coonhound mix with an insatiable appetite and a friendly, albeit sometime cheeky, disposition. We noticed he’d lost some weight and was being much more selective with his food than he normally would be. At their annual appointments Tucker’s blood test indicated he’s in kidney failure. We’ve tried some treatments over the past week including anti-nausea medicine and SQ fluids and they helped a little at first, but he hasn’t eaten at all today and he’s already lost over 25% of his body weight. We’re going to have to make the hard decision to put him down, and I’m having a super hard time following through with it. I know it’s the right thing to do, and we’ve decided that we’ll do an in-home appointment through a local vet so he isn’t terrified at the vet office. During the week we’ve been trying to prepare our kids (girls, 9 & 5) for the possibility that Tucker may need to be put down soon. It has broken my heart to watch them monitor how much he’s eating and drinking each day. Today, when he hadn’t eaten and I told them it was likely time to make the appointment, they shattered. They’ve never experienced loss and they care so much about him. They are also super concerned about our other dog, Hazel, and how she’s going to react to Tucker’s passing (truthfully my wife and I are, too). If you’re the praying type, please send some our way for Tucker and our girls. It’s gonna be a rough couple of days around here as we prepare everyone for the end. We’re gonna miss him a ton and I’m so glad we rescued him",arsears21,https://old.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1lhas3q/our_dog_is_in_kidney_failure_and_were_going_to/

But I think I need to. I can’t keep holding it in. A few years ago, I tried to end my life. I took pills. I didn’t want attention or help. I just wanted everything to stop. When my ex (22M) found out, he didn’t hold me or ask if I was okay. He didn’t call for help. He slapped me. Hard. Then again. And again. He kept asking what I took. I told him I was okay, even though I wasn’t. I was scared. I was already at rock bottom and he just made it worse. I cried. I begged him to stop. I said “please stop hitting me.” He didn’t. He looked at me like I was a problem he had to fix. Or punish. And then he acted like it didn’t happen. Like it wasn’t a big deal. Like I was overreacting. But I think about that night all the time. Not just the pills. But how the person I loved responded with violence when I needed help the most. People say if someone really wanted to die, they’d show signs. I did. And instead of comfort, I got hit. That moment changed something in me. I’m still here, but that version of me who trusted people, who still had some fight left she didn’t make it out of that night.

TrueOffMyChest,My wedding is shrinking and I don't know if I want to get married anymore. (self.TrueOffMyChest),"My partner (30 M) and I (27 M) come from really unstable backgrounds. We're both Southern and our families are really unsupportive of us being queer much less trans and in 2020-2022 things got really took a turn for the worst. Both of us in the span of two years lost/had to cut contact with one or both of our parents. 1 out of 4 of my fiance's siblings is talking to him. 1 of my siblings cut me off (I think at least, she just stopped responding 2 years ago now) and the other is very low contact. Our closest grandparents both died within a few months of eachother. Between us, we currently have a dad, a grandmother, an aunt, an uncle, a cousin, and 1.5 siblings. The family we have left is trying their best to be supportive (which is so sweet of them and we appreciate it so much) but it's really strained under the weight of everything. We moved from the South to New England to avoid the big tidal wave of anti-trans legislation. It's hard to make friends up here, but we have a few and my partner and I have have a few friends still back home. We're finally getting married after 9 years and we were initially really excited but as RSVPs have started rolling in less and less people can go. We're down to 22/35 people and shrinking. My aunt is trying her best to push people but almost no family coming. We still have some fence sitters and people have good reasons don't get me wrong, (the economy, travel expenses, conflicts, etc) but as it gets smaller it makes me feel lonely. I just wanted an small, intimate, and warm wedding like any other couple, but all its doing is stirring up more interfamily issues (especially for my partner) Now I'm afraid it's all going to be awkward and strained like every family related thing has been for the past 5 years. It's hard not to compare my wedding to my cousins' lavish Texas-sized weddings while I'm pinching pennies just to do...something, you know? This is just not what I pictured. My partner had such a hard year too I didn't want this to add to it. I know I should be grateful for what and who have (which I really am geninuely) and the money we'll be saving, but when you're used to having a big boistrious family, the quiet can be really hard to get used to.

TrueOffMyChest,We made a deal (self.TrueOffMyChest),"I am beyond frustrated. My boyfriend and I made a deal where if we got cats, he would have to change their litter as I am asthmatic (was blessed at birth). Cat litter and urine makes it hard for me to breathe, it always has. I grew up with cats where the litter wasn't changed often and I had severe asthma attacks at least once a month just from the smell alone. I cannot change the litter without having a hard time breathing and then I have to sit for a bit so my lungs can stop being assholes. The deal was that they were his responsibility. I would help feed them and brush them and provide them with entertainment (and myself, they're entertaining as hell) but they're HIS cats. I understand partnership and such but my lungs HURT lol. I told him he needed to clean the litter every day or every other day as I refuse to be a household that smells of cat pee and cat litter (plus, my asthma screws with me if gets full) otherwise we cannot have cats. Along with that, the house would need to be swept (especially around the litter) more often because of the litter tracking. I hate walking into someone's house and all I smell is cat urine and litter. Genuinely, it suffocates me lol. I know my house smelled like it growing up and I didn't want that as an adult so I never wanted cats, no matter how cute they are. I am absolutely a dog person (I do love all animals though, I just don't want to deal with the hassle of the animals I would really love to own so I don't adopt any), not too much of a cat person. They tear furniture up, they pee on clothes, they're somehow always throwing up at least once a week or every few weeks because they're self-destructive and think anything is edible. They groom themselves, yes but gawd damn they stink most of the time. You can't really bathe them unless you'd like to be clawed to hell and they track their litter EVERYWHERE. But my boyfriend loves cats and begged and begged. I caved one day, months ago and we got two cats since we could adopt two for free. They're cute, I love them but they've peed on my clothes (one somehow got into the closet which is off-limits to them and peed on) torn up some of our furniture, they're broken some of my items by jumping where they should not and I genuinely hate having to wipe my feet off because there is litter throughout the house. I have basically been taking care of the cats alone. I can count MAYBE on one hand how many times he has changed the litter, I feed them and have them on a feeding schedule, I brush them and play with them. I'm genuinely thinking about wiping them down with something where they aren't so stinky because one of them really enjoys being right up on my face. One stinks, the other one BARELY does hallelujah. I have had to BEG him multiple times to change the litter completely and he says ""I'll do it later"" or ""I'll do it after work"". (On occasion, he will act like it's the biggest inconvenience when I ask him directly to change the litter) This usually turns into a few days and then I get tired of reminding him so I do it myself, as I am suffocating. I've had to tell him multiple times that we made a deal and he doesn't seem to be grasping the fact that I genuinely cannot change the litter. I do not mind taking care of them. Again, I like cats but wouldn't have adopted any myself. It's just that I am taking care of the cats AND having to do the two stipulations I had. That's what really bugs me. I have had to beg him to hold his end of the deal up and he puts it off for so long, I end up doing it. After, he pouts and tells me ""I was going to do that"". I am at my wits end. I've had multiple conversations with him about it and nothing has changed.

I’ve called, I’ve walked, I’ve waited, and been turned away more times than I can count. Doors closed. 4 year waitlists. Requirements I can’t meet. I’ve begged for help and found nothing.

Do you know that I paid a mechanic my entire savings to fix it when it broke down back in November? That he took my money and ran? He didn't care that I would lose all my belongings. He didn't think or care about the fact that I would spend Christmas, New Years, my 24th birthday, and every holiday alone and in survival mode since. He didn't think about the fact that I'm a female alone in a dangerous city. He got what he wanted, paid. and I got left in the mud. Breaking down more and more every day.

TrueOffMyChest,"‘Best friend’ leaves me in a club alone, now going causing me to loose all my friends. (self.TrueOffMyChest)","I genuinely don't know what to do. Everyone around me is unfollowing me and unfriending me without even asking for my side of the story and it genuinely sucks. This all happened at a nightclub in London, my best friend and a few others went. Long story short, someone had left with his headphones and that's when the problem started. Long story short, he got angry at me and started shouting at me over the headphones saying that he needed them. He then saw I was speaking to a guy then said that because I made a friend, he could go and I could stay with this random dude, and he left me there. Even the guy he had left me with said he shouldn't have done that, but luckily he was a super chill dude. He then messaged me weeks later, not to check if I was okay or to apologise, but because I had his comic con ticket at my house. He then said if we could meet up so we could go together, which I said yes even though I didn't want to. Long story short, I met up with him, it was awkward because I didn't know what to say to him and then he walked off and began to block me on Instagram and on everything else, which I did the same. I then noticed people began to unfriend me on Instagram, more specifically our friend group. Which I found confusing because my ‘best friend’ would always actually badmouth them, even people he did like he'd always say something somewhat negative about them or just criticise them over anything. I would always just sit and listen to him all the time at Wetherspoons going on and on about the same thing, ironically a few weeks beforehand I realised he must've also been talking about me behind my back. One of the people who had unfriended me was unfollowed and blocked by my best friend months prior, and now magically they follow each other after this incident. But what I won't get, the people who now unfriended me always preached about getting both sides of the story, but the moment it's me it doesn't matter. I genuinely don’t know what I did wrong, all I did was react like anyone would. I've lost all my friends, 8 years of friendship down the drain because my best friend clearly said something very bad about me. I genuinely wouldn't be surprised if he told them that all the bad talking he was doing was done by me. He had always said if we've gotten into a fight it'll be over for me. I don't know what to do. I lost everyone I've hung out with, they don't want to even talk to me or even let me explain what happened between me and him, and they just decided to pick him over me with no second thought. It's causing me to lose myself, I feel so gloomy as it keeps going on and on, I just wanted to be left alone from him, and now he's trying to destroy me. Nobody will listen to me and it sucks. I did everything right with him and it still wasn't enough. I don't know how to move on from this.",_JumpyGhostface,https://old.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1lgwifx/best_friend_leaves_me_in_a_club_alone_now_going/
TrueOffMyChest,"I just lost every friend, I had because of one person, I introduced to them. (self.TrueOffMyChest)","I don’t even know where to start, because it all feels like one long nightmare that’s now just… my life. I don't know how to shorten it properly. So, I will go with the latest crux: someone I knew, let’s call her... Sandy, managed to completely dismantle every single friendship I had left. And I let it happen longer than I should have, because I was trying to be kind, understanding and Fair. But she wasn’t. Sandy has DID (Dissociative Identity Disorder), and I always tried to be patient with her and to respect what that meant, even when it was hard. Lately, her behavior crossed every line I even set for myself. No matter what I did and how, I was aways in the wrong, I was always the bad guy. Every ""rule"" she set for me, I kept to, and I still somehow f'd up. She acted sub-human towards my mum: She put her greasy food on the sofa of my mum, added her ""shoed"" feet, made nasty jokes about my mum (if we can call it that, she basically hated on her for suffering from ADHD). I tried to show her with actions (pulling the table closer to her, pointed looks, gestures), that she was acting all sorts of wrong. Considering, she was invited to a BBQ by my mum, who tried everything to make it perfect. I did tell her off about her behavior the next day, and I'm the bad person here. She played the victim and went to my friends. No clue, what she told them, but her behavior is somehow my fault. She is 33 years old. My friends stood by her side. ""It's my fault because I didn't say something right there and then."" Honestly, I think a 33 y/o should know basic manners, but I was supposed to act like her mother. I'm younger than her, btw. Things went toxic from her side and my friends continued to supported her, because she blamed it on her 8 y/o personality, which she sadly always does when she F's up. I have worked with 2-6 y/o, and they had basic manners down. In my mind, she was to be held to at least that standard, maybe that was wrong of me, idk. In the end, I went no contact with everyone but one friend, who then wrote to me today. Sandy faked an email in my name. One that insulted the one friend I kept, and made me look like a vindictive, hateful person. She actively tried to destroy my reputation, and she succeeded. Like I said, I’ve worked with children. I’ve seen 4-year-olds understand basic respect better than she did. But I was told, even by mutual friends, that I should’ve handled it differently, more gently, more publicly, more perfectly. The thing is… I did speak up, like I said. Just not in the heat of the moment, because it wasn’t the right time, I didn't want to make a spectacle, but apparently, that wasn’t good enough. Nothing I did ever was. My last friend. The one I thought I could count on, believed her. She read the fake email and believed Sandy. No questions. No doubt. Even though I’ve known her for years, and Sandy’s only been around for a few months. I even sent her proof of my outbox. No dice. Sandy took my very last friend. I’ve blocked them all, because of the hate Sandy manifested toward me. I don’t have any friends left and I’m not saying that for pity. It’s just the reality now. I feel like someone pulled the floor out from under my life. Like all the warmth is gone. I keep on getting burnt by people I let closer to me. I don't want friends anymore, they can actually hurt me. I don’t want to trust again. I don’t want to explain myself. I don’t want to wonder who’s going to turn on me next time someone cries louder than I do. I’m just… tired. Just done.",Ok_Pineapple_1001,https://old.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1lhg6fd/i_just_lost_every_friend_i_had_because_of_one/

I feel like I get bullied in this house. My step mom ignores me and barely greets me when I greet her. She only has full blown conversations with her children. My dad won’t let me talk to him about my feelings because he says he wants peace. I have no one to talk to. Both my step mom and father raised me but they didn’t raise me good at all. I grew up being a therapist for them. I feel guilty for living there, I feel guilty for breathing in the house, I feel guilty for going to the kitchen to get something to eat, I feel guilty for sleeping, I feel guilty for being in my room.

She goes to my father and vents about me to my father and I have to hear what she says about me through my father. My father doesn’t give me the chance to talk or stick up for myself. I know my step mom talks about me to my step siblings. They took my high school years away, though I still graduated. I feel like I would’ve done way better if they let me go to school in person.

TrueOffMyChest,"PositiveI gained a little brother at my summer Ivy program, I’ll miss him (self.TrueOffMyChest)","This is a bit of fluff, but I 16F made friends with this boy 14M (S). This was my first summer ever away from home and let alone across the country! I had kept to myself a lot during this program, I occasionally got asked out and I just made excuses to hide away in my dorm and it was like that for the first half of the program, I’d just be in my dorm. I made friends with this other person to bring as my plus one to go to dinner with a couple of people and I met S and his friend A there. I heard about S before, everyone knew him as this multi millionaire who had a self made fortune at 14. He’s deadass a prodigy and I wanted to learn from him a bit, I was intrigued and started a light convo. He turned out to be so sweet and shy, we shared our food with each-other and he covered the bill even after I tried running to the waiter before he could snatch it. Afterwards we went to karaoke, back to his dorm where he made me boba and sent me off with some snacks. We became good friends, occasionally I even style his curly hair! His friend A was a bit weird. He kept trying to hit on me and DM me, call me, etc etc at random times. Like sir, I want to relax. We went to a carnival and I avoided A and went on the rides with S, I found myself sort of treating him like a little brother and he said I made him feel safe to be a little childish and calm. My heart melted. I was pretty annoyed a bit at A, this guy couldn’t get a hint and he kept trying to stand too close to me and start a convo. Even during the rides I would purposely stand beside S and S got the hint and sort of worked as a blockade since he’s way taller than me and A 😭. The day after I didn’t attend lecture due to severe cramps and I guess one of my dorm mates told S and he came to my dorm with Matcha and some warm soup with snacks. Honestly, from there on out I full on loved being his sort of older sister of a friend. We would play card games, go on matcha runs, I’d help him ask out a girl he liked, and we’d have our moments were we’d gossip about what annoyed us that day! The program ended, and he lives across the ocean. He helped me move into my sisters dorm were I would be staying and the day after I hung out with him before his flight. It was sort of a bitter sweet goodbye, and I went with him to this sorta old cathedral to escape the sun and the humidity plus because he wanted to visit. I’m not Christian, but I figured why not. We had a good talk and a three minute long hug where I just gave him advice and said how grateful I was to have made such an amazing friend. I genuinely have never been hugged that long and never have really squished someone. And I promised that I would still keep in contact as he did. I always thought it was bluff that someone can be like family without being family and I was so wrong.

TrueOffMyChest,Secret Wedding Guilt (self.TrueOffMyChest),"My fiancé and I (30s) are getting married this year. We asked a family member to officiate but realized the 1hr online course no longer exists. We then thought we would do a courthouse wedding to just sign the paperwork and then have her do the ceremony for our family and friends. The courthouse wedding is simply meeting an officiant at a park bench, getting her to ask us the legal questions and then signing the paper and parting ways. Im feeling crazy guilt from my mom as she is making it a big deal that she's missing it. She keeps telling me it's strange and doesn't understand. I initially felt good about my decision until she mom guilted me. The paperwork is supposed to be signed next week and I'm loosing sleep over this. If she was more supportive then I would be excited for this decision. The few friends I've talked to about this are supportive, understanding and are not making a big deal about this. My fiancé is feeling solid about the plan and doesn't see signing the paper as a big deal. I am overthinking and considering how to cancel this secret signing and telling my aunt I need to find a legal officiant and not have her do our wedding.",Relative_Sail9285,https://old.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1lhd8uh/secret_wedding_guilt/
TrueOffMyChest,Im in love with my best friend but he doesn’t see me that way (self.TrueOffMyChest),"I don’t know where else to say this. But I think I’ve fallen for my best friend. We talk every day. We have the most random, soft conversations. He knows so much about me. I feel the safest when I’m with him. He gets my mood shifts, I’ve never felt this emotionally attached to someone before. But he doesn’t see me the same way. I know that. He has just gotten into a relationship now. He talks about her so softly. Carefully. She’s really pretty, confident. The kind of girl you do fall for. And I’m just me. His comfort friend. The person he tells random things to. The one he shows up for at 1am with pizza when she is upset, but not because he loves he just because he cares. As a friend. It hurts. Sometimes i feel he likes me but then the next moment my bubble bursts. I don’t even think I want to confess. I don’t want to ruin what we have. Im scared if I tell him, I’ll lose the only closeness I have with him. But at the same time, its so painful to love someone who sees you as just a best friend. To hype him up, support him, be there through everything and know he’s thinking about someone else. I don’t know what to do. I just know this feeling is exhausting me. I want to keep him in my life. But I don’t know how to stop feeling like this when I see him smile at his phone because of her. Today felt really heavy. I was ranting to him about what I learned today during my clinical. I was really excited. Sending him big ass paragraphs about what happened today. And mid convo he told me to wait. Since she was calling. All my excitement faded. I brushed it off. Replied to him that he should pick her call. Heheheh. Wished him Good night. God I feel so pathetic .Why can’t i just see him like my other friends. Has anyone gone through this? Is there a way to fall out of love while still staying close?

TrueOffMyChest,I feel like my boyfriend’s “replacement”. I feel guilty for being with him (self.TrueOffMyChest),"We haven’t been dating very long, almost 6 months now. I didn’t really want to start dating him, it was just kind of how it played out. Not gonna go into too much detail, but the relationship definitely feels rooted in sex. He has been extremely insistent on getting married and having a kid someday (I am 21M and he is 26M), and I wasn’t sure why. I explained to him that I do NOT want to get married, but might be open to kids in the future… like way in the future, maybe a decade from now. I’ve also explained that if we do decide to have a kid, I want to be comfortable financially, have an actual house with a small yard, and want to get my mental health issues sorted out. Since our first few days being officially together, he’s always bringing up the desire to have kids… and recently, I feel like I know why. We started talking about previous relationship experiences, and he opened up about how in his last relationship, he had a fiancée who got pregnant with his kid. She ended up having a miscarriage, and they later broke up. Not sure how much later and if the miscarriage was part of the reason, but these are all hard things for him to go through. Lately, however, I came to a realization. I think the reason that he’s SO insistent on getting married and having kids is because he wants to pick up where he left off on his last relationship. I understand that he’s a bit older and wants to settle down, but I am nowhere near ready for that… nor do I want to get married. At all. I have explained that multiple times, and he still is VERY insistent on marriage and children. We don’t live close enough to each other to even be able to care for a child together. He lives about 2 hours away from me, so he’s been insisting we move in together. All of this is happening really fast, and I’m not sure how to feel about it all. I feel guilty for it, I guess. I feel like I’m inadvertently leading him on, but at the same time, I have explained multiple times in detail WHY I do not want to do these things. Because our relationship started after becoming intimate with each other, I have also started to feel as if that’s the only thing we have going for each other, and I feel really bad about it. We didn’t get to know each other very well before we started dating, and because of that, we have little to no overlapping interests. I will add that I would’ve waited at least another month before we started dating, but again, he was extremely insistent on dating. I feel really bad about it all. I really can’t see a future with him, especially because I cannot willfully give him the future he wants, and so I feel like I’m inadvertently leading him on. I don’t even know how to begin discussing this with him. He’s not the overly sensitive type, but I feel like he’d crumble to pieces if I started to even imply that we won’t be together in the future. I know I should just man up and tell him these things, but I don’t even know where to begin. He crosses my boundaries a lot, annoys me constantly, always pushes my buttons like a toddler or young child would… and I just cannot see myself doing this long-term. I feel so horrible about it. Part of me wants to just tell him to his face that if he wants to get married and have kids so soon, he needs to find somebody else… but I feel that’s too harsh, even if that’s the truth. I am also worried that he might retaliate physically if I tell him. He told me he got into a “stupid domestic violence” situation and had to go to court over it. He says he only acted in self defense, but I have no idea, I’ve only got his word to go with. He’s also a bit bigger than I am, and much stronger, so I worry about how things would go if he didn’t take it well. I know I’m prolonging the inevitable by continuing to be with him, and I know the longer this goes on, the more it’ll hurt him, but I’m just at a loss. He always makes sure to tell me what a good boyfriend I am, and I know deep down that I am not. Our relationship started while I was having a manic episode. I don’t think I would’ve done any of that had I been in a normal state of mind, and I always feel so disgusted with myself when he mentions how the first date went down, because I didn’t mean for it to go that way. I just feel horrible. TLDR: Boyfriend of nearly 6 months insists on getting married and having kids, but our relationship started during my manic episode and I don’t think I can keep doing this, and I feel horrible about it.",cryocryptid44,https://old.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1lgw2en/i_feel_like_my_boyfriends_replacement_i_feel/
TrueOffMyChest,I can't turn the page so I write him a letter that he will never read. (self.TrueOffMyChest),"This is a letter that I wrote for a person who marked my life in a very short time. I can't send it to him, so I'm posting it here. Just need someone to read it. You. Two weeks ago I saw something I hadn't expected. I experienced one of the most beautiful and also one of my most painful encounters. One Friday evening, I opened this app, as we sometimes do without really believing it, more out of solitude than desire. And there you were. We talked, we agreed to see each other. It was supposed to be quick and easy. We ended up in your car. Two clumsy guys, a little hesitant. We called ourselves straight, it was a vague, somewhat hidden game. We didn't expect anything. But it was that evening that it all started. That moment in your car lasted two hours. Not just for sex, no. There were the looks, the smiles, the caresses, the nervous laughter, the confidences slipped between two silences. It was sweet. It was real. We exchanged our snaps. I wrote to you when I got home. We said good night. The next morning, you sent me a message as soon as you woke up. And then another. Yet another one. We talked all day. Photos, jokes, a bond that is forged without us knowing what it is. In the evening we were each out with our friends, but we talked to each other as if we didn't want to talk. And I, in my head, started thinking, “Something’s happening. » On Sunday, you wrote to me again first thing in the morning. You were working, you were tired, but you found time to write to me. In the evening I came to your house. We sat down on the sofa but quickly moved into the bedroom. It was strong. Carnal, yes, but also sincere. I couldn't think of anything other than being in your arms. When I got home, we said good night. Again with lots of kisses. And I was already falling. Even if I didn't want to admit it to myself. The next day, we continued to talk non-stop. And when there was a little misunderstanding, you called me right away. We spent the evening on FaceTime. I loved hearing your voice, seeing you smile. Tuesday. I waited for you to write to me. I wanted it to come from you. And you did it. You wrote to me: “No news is good news.” I think you were asking. I smiled like an idiot. I was happy. In the evening we saw each other again. Another cuddly, sensual, complicit evening. We were so good together. You teased me, you sought me out, you told me not to fall in love. And I was laughing, pretending it was just fun. But it was too late. On Wednesday you were more distant. You took longer to respond, you were elsewhere. In the evening, I wanted to talk to you, call you, see you. You told me you were tired. You didn't call me back. I started to doubt. On Thursday, we saw each other again, we were with your friend. A more neutral evening, we went to eat in town and have a drink. But I no longer recognized the same proximity. You weren't bad. Just...far. I offered to come over to your place afterwards, you told me no. I came home. A little sad, lost. On Friday, I sent you messages, but you responded sparsely. On Saturday, I suggested you go out. You weren't available. On Sunday, I didn't send anything. I wanted to give you space. And then on Monday, I couldn't take it anymore. I asked you what was going on. You told me that you didn't feel like talking to me or seeing me. You told me you felt I was getting too attached. I lied. I said no. I said it was cool, we were just friends. But deep down, I knew you were right. I asked you if you wanted to stop there or if you want to talk about it. You said, “I’ll tell you. » And since then... nothing. I don't know if I blame you. No. I don't blame you. But I'm in pain. Because I felt something strong, true, alive. And you moved on. I know you didn't mean to hurt me. I know maybe it was too much, too fast, too strong. I know you didn't want to get attached. But I fell. And I stood there, waiting for a message that never came. Today, I still think of you. Not like you think of an ex or a big story. No. Like a storm that passed through my life, and left everything turned upside down. I don't know if we'll ever talk again. I don't know if I should say goodbye or just see you soon. But what I know is that I will never forget the thrills, the laughter, the looks, your voice, and that rare feeling that I felt in your arms. Even though you'll never know, thanks for that. Thanks for you.",LostInTheWeb_T,https://old.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1lh0me8/i_cant_turn_the_page_so_i_write_him_a_letter_that/
TrueOffMyChest,Male Anorgasmia for Over Ten Years (self.TrueOffMyChest),"As the title says, I have been unable to orgasm during sex for over ten years and I honestly didn't realize this had been going on so long until it hit me just a little while ago. I didn't think of it as a big problem because I really haven't ever been in a position to confidently get anyone pregnant and provide or contribute to stability for a family. I normally just ""go"" until my partner feels satisfied, exhausted, or (preferably) both so it's kind of been a huge benefit, I guess. To take care of myself, I'd often rely on corn, which I could always use to bring myself to orgasm at any time. That was, until recently. Before continuing I need to give some background information about myself to help understand the context a little better - I am a bit of a freak. Not sexually but physiologically, I have all sorts of inexplicable abnormalities with my body - from slightly unusually elastic skin to having the ability to erect and relax the tiny hairs on my skin at will. I will spare you the odder details but suffice it to say, that's not an exhaustive list. The issue at the subject of this post seemed to me to be one of the least odd things in my life as a young man exploring relationships. Despite all that, I'm relatively normal looking, very healthy, in good shape, and you'd probably not guess these things when looking at me. I think it's only bothersome to me because, recently, I find it impossible to even enjoy pornography but, at the same time, I also find it hard not to look at it - either out of habit or desperation. Maybe I relied on the corn a little too much and I'm glad if my body is telling me to do something different so here I am reaching out. I don't think of myself as an addict and have always had the ability to control my urges very well. Can anyone give me any insight at all as to what is going on with me? I have the idea that I'm just waiting for the right person but I'm really not sure.",Emotional-Source9778,https://old.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1lh5lv4/male_anorgasmia_for_over_ten_years/

TrueOffMyChest,CONTENT WARNING: SEXUAL ASSAULTIs what I went through considered SA? (self.TrueOffMyChest),"Hello, I’m coming on here to ask a question because I’m so confused and I just want the truth. Please don’t worry about sugarcoating anything, just let me know if what happened is odd or if other parents do this stuff with their kids. I am a 19 year old female. Ever since I was a kid my mom would make me strip in front of her. I remember at 8 saying no and that I didn’t want to but she would say she gave birth to me so it didn’t matter. I would go along with it because most times if I ever did argue back it would cause fights and be a huge conflict and my mother would go crazy so I just agreed. When I would strip she would grab my butt and squeeze it and tell me I needed to grow it or that it was to flat and she would grab my chest and tell me it was saggy and needed to make it perky. I would try to get her to stop touching but she would just keep going. One time she made me strip down and dragged me infront of the mirror to tell me that no one would love or come near me because I was so ugly. And made me repeat it to myself. I just want to know if that is a thing mothers do, like the whole stripping thing or if that is odd. After the age of 13 I would just go to my room and change and she would just walk into my room knowing I was changing and I’d have to hold the door closed and yell for her to wait. She’s stoped trying now but I just don’t know what to make of this. Another thing is both my mom and my dad would always touch my butt. Like my dad would run around the house chasing me and try to pinch my butt or they would both when passing by hit my butt. I’m not sure if that’s odd because maybe it’s just teasing or getting you to move out of the way. All of this is normal to me so I’m not sure how to feel, I just want external perspectives. Overall I just want the truth. The last thing I want to do is misuse the word sa because it’s serious and I don’t want to claim something that is not true. Please let me know what you think.

TrueOffMyChest,If my sister wasn't my sister.... (self.TrueOffMyChest),"I (36f) am starting not to like my sister (38f). I feel bad, but its been building over the years. We've always had a rocking relationship since we were kids. She was raised by our grandmother and aunts in the south, while I was raised by our drug addict mother in the north. I was always sent south during the summers. I did stay one school year, it was hell. Sister always made up stories to get me in trouble. Whenever I would get yelled at or whooped, she would always come stare at me and have this evil smirk on her face. Sister told so many stories on me, one in particular, I was playing on the bus with a boy classmate. Sister saw this, stared at me and went to the back of the bus. When we got to our stop, she left me, ran home and told our grandmother that I was letting a boy feel on me (so not true) She's always had this hatred towards me because I was with our mom, but she failed to realized that I had to deal with our moms drug addiction, living out of our cars, living in an abandoned apartment building for 7 years, sexual abuse, etc while she got wake up in a nice home, food, hot water, etc. She finally got hit with reality when she came up north to finally live with us and saw how we really lived. We both were in high school. Sister kept drama up, made up medical conditions to get sympathy from people, kept up so much tension in the house. As grew into our 20s, she kept up division in the family, eventually falling out with family because everyone was calling her out on her bullshit. Now, she doesn't talk to anyone in our family but me. Before our mom passed away, I was always caught in the middle of their drama. Sister will spazz at mom, mom feelings would get hurt,mom would complain to me, I would ask sister what was going on, sister would always accuse me of taking sides, so I told them to leave me out of it. Everything quiet down, sister had babies, mom's health took a turn, me and sister fell out. 6 months later, Sister didn't come to the hospital when mom was on her deathbed, didnt come to the funeral, but told the whole family I didn't include her in the planning, I stopped talking to her for a while. Fast foward, I've had a medical issues for 3 years straight, she didn't come visit while I was in the hospital multiple times, didn't come to check on me at all while recovering from medical situation. Never drove to my home to visit, I always had to come to her, it was the only times I could see her and the kids. We've been on good terms for a while but now it's getting exhausting. We stay 50 miles way from each other, but since my latest diagnoses of Vasovagal syncope/POTS, I'm not able to drive by myself for long distances (I may go 10 miles tops by myself on a good day) so my boyfriend has been driving me around. She asked me to come watch her kids for her a few times, pulling the ""I don't have any help or no family to help with my kids"" card (which I have) but lately she's been having trouble with the daycare center being available around her work schedule (the pervious daycare center was great, but she took the kids out because ""the teacher said one of the kids looked evil and attcked another kid"", so she cursed them and took the kids out). All was good at the time because my boyfriend was laid off work, so he would drive me to her house (she said my boyfriend couldn't be around the kids without her because its too much to have a man besides their father around them) so he would drop me off and pick me up (200 miles round trip). Now my boyfriend is back working full time, shes needing a sitter because the daycare would be closed for some days. I told her that her and my boyfriends schedule overlaps now, I wouldn't make it to her home in time so she can make it to work on time. I did express if boyfriend doesn't have to work the previous night, I would be avaliable. She said it's fine, I told her to let me know. She's now ignoring me because I can't help her. It really gets under my skin because I want to help but its out of my hands/control. She is notorious for this when I say no or I cant to her, and honestly, I'm over it. TLDR; Sister treated me like crap growing up, now I can't help her so she's ignoring me, I'm tired of her and the mental drain it has on me.",National-Job-515,https://old.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1lgu1z4/if_my_sister_wasnt_my_sister/
TrueOffMyChest,It's almost been 10 years since I've started being depressed and suicidal and the end is near (self.TrueOffMyChest),"There is no fun in life, there is no enjoyment in life, there's only indifference or pain. It started out when I was 13 when I got emotionally abused and treated like an insect by someone I found very close to me. It ended when I was 15 and I started getting closer to the most wonderful girl in the world, but my insecurities prevented me from ever noticing that she liked me and I just thought she hated me for years, torturing myself like that. Four years ago, she left me, ended the friendship as she thought I was merely using her love, and such I lost the only positive I've had in my life. I dropped out of college 1 year ago as I couldn't maintain any sort of consistency. I had an excellent cv and qualifications, but I've been too depressed to even apply for jobs (I have one lined up right now but I've been ghosting the guy for a week), and every time I've gotten close to someone in the past 4 years, they all turned out to be emotionally unavailable for one reason or another. I've become friends with a girl in December and everything was going well until April when she pulled back because she thought it was inappropriate how much we talked. My biggest hobby are cars and I focused on it for the past 4 years, now owning a nice vintage Mercedes and BMW, and both got hit in May by distracted drivers one after the next. Time and time in the past, I kept telling myself that I would look back and be happy that I didn't kill myself and that life would get better; I wish I killed myself 10 years ago. Every day is hell and I am lucky to be able to get out of bed. I have no future, everybody becomes repulsed by me eventually, I just wish I could disappear without my family being hurt by it. I hope I can go to sleep and never wake up",BMWtrunkseal,https://old.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1lhhle5/its_almost_been_10_years_since_ive_started_being/
TrueOffMyChest,Mental health is not great marital issues arent helping. (self.TrueOffMyChest),"So I'm a man in my 30s married to my wife who is about the same age. We have been together happily for a long time. We had all these big plans and most of them have gone well. But a couple things have been really not working out. So the first thing is my mental health. I've been spiraling for about a month, good days and dark days. Just crying randomly, low sleep, not eating. Work is killing me because of how isolating it is. My family makes it worse because none of them understand, for a long time my wife said I needed to get help, I would agree and I would ask for her help finding that only to run up against a wall. I'm on her insurance and Everytime I try to figure this out it's led to a dead end. Until a few weeks ago I finally found someone on my own planning to pay out of pocket. It kind of left me feeling abandoned when I needed someone to walk with me and she was the only one and she didn't. I forgive her for it but it really hurts. She's been different for awhile not like infidelity, but it's like a lot of times I speak and nothing really seems to land. So the other big thing is children. Growing up in a broken home without a father I always wanted to fulfill that role. I wanted to pour all the love I have pent up inside me and put it into another person. Support them, cherish them, help them grow, I didn't want to do it because I wanted to possess a person or anything weird like that. I just always wanted to be a great father. But it's never happened. Until a few years ago our sex life was incredible, but she went from initiating about half the time to never. Like it's been about 2 years since she has. We have been trying for a child for longer than that. It hurts us both, we talk about it but she is avoidant. She acknowledges the problem but won't help with the solution. She mentions the state of things or any number of excuses but just doesn't seem willing to take any tangible action. A few years ago she went to the doctor and talked about these issues and ended up getting some meds that were supposed to help. But they made her feel natious so she never took them after the first few days. I just feel like as we're getting older it becomes harder to get pregnant and the divide seems to be growing. I thought I would be okay with just adopting, but at this point I don't really know. So many thoughts rolling through my head. I want to get checked out but I feel like maybe were heading for ruin. I met my therapist and I'm excited to work on some of my issues but this is one where I just don't know where this road leads. What if I can't reconcile with this, what if I end up saying things that are hurtful that I regret that alter our relationship. Maybe with the mental health issues and trauma I've experienced I should just be grateful that anyone would love me and that I would find someone I love in this cruel place. I like to think that our marriage is strong enough to survive anything. But talking about these issues has made me realize that maybe our priorities have shifted.

TrueOffMyChest,I (16F) Have An Emotional Attachment To A Necklace (self.TrueOffMyChest),"So my friend (who was 14) was murdered in September of 2023, at this point it has been almost two years, and I have a necklace with some of his ashes in it. I cannot leave the house without it on. I only take it off out of concern of it flying off at an amusement park or when I'm showering. I feel like there should come a day where I can take it off, but I'm so attached to it, to the memory of him, that I can't. Is this an issue? I feel like by taking it off i'm letting him go. I don't feel ready to do that. I feel like there has to be a physical representation of me carrying him with me in my every step. I also think allowing myself to exist without it would feel freeing. I don't want to live under the weight of my grief. My friends who knew him have the same necklace and never wear it except for special occasions. I feel like I'm being dramatic, but I can't let it go. I know I have to eventually. Not sure if there's any advice to be given, I just feel embarrassed about this and wasn't sure where to go.",Jazzlike-Elk4968,https://old.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1lh27ci/i_16f_have_an_emotional_attachment_to_a_necklace/

TrueOffMyChest,scared to death about going to school due to past trauma (self.TrueOffMyChest),"it happened last school year. i was the typical shy and lonely girl, but i did have one good friend. at the time i was struggling with depression and anorexia. then one day a boy had approached me and we quickly became good friends. he cared for me by making sure i ate, telling me how beautiful i was, said he loved me which was something rare to hear, and made me the happiest i ever felt in a long time. it didn't take long for me to develop feelings. but he had also reminded me of an old friend who i had a crush on at the time, but he got a girlfriend and ended his life only a few months later. i was still grieving a bit, and it felt like i was given a second chance. i promised myself i wouldn't let anything happen to him. after a while we finally went on out first date, although we weren't dating yet. we held hands and he told me he loved me and i was so sure he would soon ask me to be his girlfriend. unfortunately, things weren't that simple. because not long after out date, he told me he didn't love me anymore. he didn't give an explanation or apology. i cried and begged him not to do this me, but he acted like i never meant anything to him. i relapsed in minutes and began cutting and starving myself. i hated myself for failing again. it felt like i had done something wrong, but i didn't know what. i punished myself like i had committed an unforgivable sin that i had to spend the rest of my life atoning for. i kept telling myself that i needed to get over it, but no matter how hard i tried, i just couldn't. we were only friends for a few months, but it felt like it hurt more than it should. i cried every night against my will, but it only got worse from there. he noticed that i stopped eating lunch and only sat with me to bully me. he said things like that i looked sick, that i did this to myself, and that nobody cared about what would happen to me. he would keep going until i cried. i let him say horrible things to me, because i still loved him and i hoped he would stop. as i was being bullied however, no one at the table, not even my best friend since middle school, stood up for me. one of his friends had assaulted me and i went to him crying, but he defended his friend. i went to two different counselors, but they both told me the same thing: ""well if he does something in the future..."". i even went to my parents but they told me i was strong enough to handle it, but i wasn't. i was passing out at school pretty often, but he wouldn't even bat an eye. he did eventually stop bullying me, probably because he got bored, but it gets even worse. everything crumbled again after i found out he had gotten a girlfriend. all of the memories of him treating me badly that i had pushed to back of my mind came flooding out. and i felt a kind of fear i didn't know was humanly possible. my brain probably had enough of me tolerating him and attempted to keep me safe by making me see him as a dangerous person. i developed an extreme fear of him, even his name would make my heart stop. if i saw him my fight or flight response would be triggered and i ran away and hid, trying my best to not have a panic attack. i changed my routes and went through eight hours of constant fear. it almost felt like a sick horror game. sometimes i could've sworn i saw ""hold shift to run"" in the corner of my eye. time passed and my fear didn't subside, but i begin to feel lonely. i began to feel desperate and ended up with a toxic boyfriend. he ignored me a lot and encouraged my eating disorder. i felt miserable, but i also felt like i didn't deserve the kind of love i wanted. and to make matters worse, my boyfriend was a friend of my bully, which i didn't know at the time. it only took a few weeks for me to find out, and i felt devasted. it also felt like i had been set up for more pain. i vented to my best friend and i guess she must have said something to my boyfriend because he went off on me. he told me that his friends were right about me ""not being good enough"". he ended the relationship. i became more depressed and every day i felt closer to death. for weeks i was considering ending my life but i just didn't have the energy. i did end up collapsing at a family event and i ended up in the hospital for quite some time. after some discussions with social workers, it was decided that it would be best to homeschool me for the remaining of the school year, which was nearly over. i ended up slowly recovering and after months, i finally felt at peace. i still kept in touch with my best friend and she cried a lot on my behalf. she said she would get revenge on him for me and i trusted her. and just as things were getting better, they got worse. my best friend said that she was dating my ex boyfriend and was friends with my bully, so now she didn't want to get revenge. she said no one would believe me so i should just let it go. i was pretty upset and i did go off on her, but it was clear whose side she was on. my therapist advised cutting her off. she was my only friend, so it did hurt to block her. it was also hard to heal because i kept having nightmares of my bully, where i would see him and have to endure a panic attack. no matter how hard i think i can't think of a reason as to why he did this to me. was it because i'm disabled? i was only recently diagnosed with autism, but maybe he realized something was wrong with me. was it because he was just bored? did i just not notice the red flags? even now i'm still struggling to cope. i had a past suicide attempt years ago, and sometimes i wish i had actually died so this wouldn't have happened. i'll have to go back to school this year and i'm scared for my life. what if a rumor was spread about me? i changed my appearance as much as i could in hopes that nobody will recognize me. and i know this whole thing will probably mess with future relationships. i don't want to be lonely for the rest of my life, but it feels like nothing is worth the risk. it feels like in order to keep myself safe, i have to push others away. i don't know if i will fully heal by the time school starts. if i end up seeing him i don't know how i will react. it feels like i'm putting myself in danger. i just want to feel safe.",friedchicken2038745,https://old.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1lhfj92/scared_to_death_about_going_to_school_due_to_past/
TrueOffMyChest,I feel like I’m drowning (self.TrueOffMyChest),"I don't know how to explain it without sounding dramatic, but it's like I've been disappearing quietly. Not in any visible way, just internally, like something is slowly shutting down. I wake up already exhausted. Everything feels too much, yet nothing touches me. It's not sadness exactly, it's more like being hollow. Like a part of me went missing months ago and I've been pretending I didn't notice. I'm scared it's never coming back. It’s started to affect my relationship as well. I’d like to spend more time with my boyfriend and drastically cut down my hours working as a lawyer since my pay check (thank god) allows it. He,on the other hand, is very busy with his restaurant, and it’s going well since he’s opened it. I understand he needs more employees to be able to take more time off. I feel so frustrated at everything and it comes so easily. Case didn’t turn out how I would’ve liked to? Frustrated. Boyfriend doesn’t stick to his mundane promises to me, like going to the movies with me or going to draw on ceramics? Frustrated. An employee of his called in sick and he has to cover? Frustrated. Those are things that would usually just irritate me for a few minutes, but it’s gotten to the point where I have to physically cool off or just leave the room because he irritates me to a point of pure frustration. We’ve been talking about my feelings and how I’m trying to deal with it and he’s very supportive, so I’m considering myself as a very lucky woman. I’ve also started another degree and to be fair, that’s on me, but I’ve been also slacking in that department. I physically can’t get myself to study or go to classes. Even when I was working full time I was always able to easily keep up and study and spend time with friends and family. But now? I feel like everything is a huge task, a mountain I’ll never be able to summit. And it’s so much more frustrating when I think about how that’s what I’ve wanted to study in first place and now I just can’t- seemingly- do anything to move forward with it. I feel like that piece has gone missing a while ago. I desperately want it back, but I’m afraid I’ll never get it back.",One-Banana-8110,https://old.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1lh8go2/i_feel_like_im_drowning/

TrueOffMyChest,Am I the problem? (self.TrueOffMyChest),"I guess it’s resulted in this but I need to know if I’m the actual problem or if there is something more going on and I just can’t decipher who’s in the right, my (f20) parents (f42 m51) do not get a long all the time ever since I was like 7 there’s been a few incidents for example when I was 8 my grandparents are very mean but my parents wanted to go out by themselves so they were driving me and my younger siblings over to my grandparents house so they could watch us and I was crying because my grandparents are so mean and they just treat me like crap but the whole way I was crying even up to their door but that annoyed my dad and he got so mad he grabbed me dragged me back to the car and threw me in with so much force I slammed into my little sisters car seat. There’s been a few more times since then but it’s a similar story. Anyways fast forward to now they haven’t hit me in any way probably since I was 16 but I feel like they treat me like a maid, I have a full time job and I’m a full time student so I already don’t have a lot of time to myself and when I get home they ask me to watch our 5 dogs and then on the weekends everyone want to relax so they ask me to watch the dogs so they can go relax so they get to chill but the only time I really get to myself is if I have to do homework. So on Mother’s Day my dad was like “your mother does so much for us maybe you can get up and watch the dogs and make her breakfast” and although I was a little annoyed I just sucked it up and was planning on doing it to keep the peace. Then that morning comes and I just feel horrible I’m in so much pain I wasn’t able to sleep so when I finally was I over slept and my siblings ended up getting the dogs out instead of me. My dad was so mad he wouldn’t talk to me so then I tried to talk to my mom and she was like “he’s mad cuz he just wanted you to do this one thing” and I lost it I know I’m at fault here a little because I should’ve just got up and worked through the pain but I just let everything out about how I was feeling and that I would have got up I was in just so much pain and it’s almost like she didn’t believe me but it got worse we got into a fight and I sat in my room and cried all day and then I text them apologizing and they said it’s okay I just need to start acting like I’m part of the family which I’m not fully sure what that means yet. But that was the first issue then a week later I went to the hospital turns out I had a chest infection from when I had heart surgery in January and the pocket was positioned in a way that it was pushing on one of my nerves which was why I was in so much pain and it wasn’t just all in my head. Today another fight happened my parents are gonna go out and I’m just so stressed because I know I have to watch the dogs and I have a panic attack because of it and after I calm down I express my feelings to my mom that it feels like I never have a moment to relax because I always have to do something for someone else and she gets mad cuz no one has asked me to watch the dogs but I rebutted by saying I know it will happen because it does every single time and then she says that I just don’t voice how I’m feeling and that if I did this wouldn’t be a problem. But at this moment in time I was voicing how I felt and this is how she acted so we were yelling at each other and then I turn around and ask my sister if she thinks we will have to watch the dogs and if it happens a lot and my moms yelling at me that it doesn’t involve her and my sister just nods her head yes and my mom went crazy she is screaming how she’s done and I thought she was gonna crash the car honestly but then she’s saying how I never think of anyone else and that all of our issues affects everyone. So I guess I just come here to ask if I really am the problem because I honestly can’t tell anymore like my brain is telling me that parents shouldn’t act this way but my parents are telling me that I’m the problem and I don’t know what to believe",Future-Store-1716,https://old.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1lgzow3/am_i_the_problem/

Father didn’t really want my mother but married her because she got pregnant to me - as he never forgets to remind me until today. Not a happy marriage and I was her consolation, she would repeatedly teach me how bad my father was treating her and would use me as her support against him. Age 16, bullied at school, father was worried that I didn’t have any girlfriend. He came to the point to threaten to kill me if he ever found out I was gay. Irony - many years after when he was lying in a hospital bed with high possibilities of dying, his threat was the first thing that came to my mind. I’m almost crying while writing this now. I had to prove that I was worth. Good at school, at university, started working early and gave it all to become financially independent and leave that home of trauma. A couple of short relationships with men - but I never felt good myself, always felt I was doing smth wrong that I should. Plus never felt loved by a man - it was always about sex. For years in love with a girl from university that I couldn’t have, and a male work colleague that we became close friends, until I took the courage to come out. I was rejected and ghosted. Then I met a woman - my current wife. First time I felt loved. Once the first panic attacks started, I started therapy. The therapist was denying my sexuality, said I did it all as a reaction to my father, tried to convince me I felt so bad because “I thought” I liked men. Conversion therapy it is called nowadays - but who knew 25 years back. Fast forward today: multiple burnouts from work - I am also a provider man and wife was reluctant to go work, I took the courage to come out to her and she accepted me. Still I’m not happy - I miss having a man in my life, as I am middle aged now and never enjoyed it. Still not “proud” about my sexuality (why should anyone be anyway), still confused, still not satisfied with life, therapy continues, repeated medical treatments, cases where I, the victim, became the perpetrator. Future: not sure what’s coming. But I’m long registered at Exit in case things go south. My point: if pride was a thing when I was growing up and society was at least a bit reluctant with people like me, I might have done better life choices. And not have felt and made other people fell so bad. So just fkn let us be; no one chose to be who they are. We have enough life problems like everyone else, don’t make it worse. Just mind your business and love your children for what they are.",Weak-Worldliness-394,https://old.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1lh6xo1/pride_day_today_a_personal_contemplation/
regret,I think married my rapist (self.regret),"I grew up in a Christian home and had very limited experience with the opposite sex. I was quite naive about sexual relationships and planned on waiting until marriage. I moved away from home at 20 after finishing two years of community college to go to a university and while I was there working I I met my now husband. He invited me to go play soccer at the park and when we finished he invited me back to his place for dinner. After we ate we sat on his couch talking and he kept making sexual jokes that I, being so naive just awkwardly laughed at. Eventually he started rubbing my thigh and told me I turned him on and pulled me on top of him. When he started pulling down my pants I told him I didn’t want to have sex and he just asked why. I told him I just didn’t want to and he said that he promised he wouldn’t put it in all the way and he just wanted to feel me. I told him I didn’t want to and he just told me to trust him it would be fine. I should have gotten up and left but I just froze. He kept rubbing himself against me and I tried to pull away, not forcefully but enough for him to notice because he pulled me back on top of him and partially penetrated me without fully going in several times. Eventually he stopped and finished in his hand and told me I was lucky he was nice because most guys would have just fully penetrated me. I didn’t really process what happened, I just knew I felt gross and couldn’t believe I was in that situation. I messaged him and told him I never wanted to do that again and he invited me back the next day to talk. He told me it wasn’t “sex” because he only partially went in and that he really liked me and wanted to keep seeing me. I didn’t want to but it was my first sexual encounter and I felt like if I dated him it wouldn’t be as bad that I let it happen. I know it doesn’t make sense but that’s how I felt. Anyway, fast forward and he did that several more times despite the fact that I told him it made me uncomfortable and I cried the whole time. I know it doesn’t make sense but I didn’t want to do stuff with more than one guy so I stayed with him. Eventually I even developed feelings and fell in what I thought was love. We have three kids now, and sometimes I hate him. I get mad at almost everything he does but I keep it to myself. Almost every time we have sex I cry because I feel abused and it reminds me of the first night when I asked him to stop and he wouldn’t. He’s apologized now, and said he genuinely thought I wanted it and didn’t get how he could rape me if I was on top. I’ve explained that I said no and he didn’t stop and he feels bad now but I feel like the damage is already done. I hold most of the pain in because I don’t know what to do. He’s changed so much from who he used to be and for what it’s worth I think he’s sorry but it doesn’t make me feel better. I hate kissing or touching him and I have to pretend I’m happy so our kids aren’t negatively impacted but it kills me inside. I don’t think I fully grasped what happened until a few years into our marriage but I already had kids and now I just feel lost",Wise_Grapefruit9276,https://old.reddit.com/r/regret/comments/ljpe0x/i_think_married_my_rapist/
regret,I regret marrying a personality-disordered whackjob. (self.regret),"My divorce hearing is Tuesday. I'm hoping it will be finalized then. I filed over a year and a half ago but there have been so many delays due to the pandemic and other factors. I'm not an expert in the field but I think she's a narcissist/borderline combo. I don't care to relive all the details here but I tolerated all kinds of abuse from her over the years, emotional and sometimes physical, and always tried to make it work. Then she cheated on me and I was like, fuck it. I just stopped trying. To this day she works her ass off to hoover me back into it. But it won't work. I'm done. Friends and neighbors, please don't ever get into or try to maintain a shitty relationship just from fear of being alone. You will find a good partner if you hold out.

regret,I was naive about what being gay was about. (self.regret),"I came from a traditional Baptist family and I was sheltered from things that didn't agree with Baptist principles. At 22 years old I joined the Air Force and went into basic training. One night while performing night guard duty, a fellow airman was filling to take over being night guard, but confessed being gay and had a terrible time adjusting to basic training. I thought, being my naive self, that the Training Instructor could help him. So, I notified the training instructor, that the person who confided in me was gay and needed help. I didn't know about the hatred for gay men. I later found out that he was discharged. I am haunted to this day 45 years later.

regret,Lost the love of my life (self.regret),"I’m 33 now. And I feel like it’s too late to have a good life. I was a bartender when we met. I was 25. She was 21. She was a student. She was everything I’d ever wanted. The entire reason I’d become a bartender was to meet HER. She was sweet. Innocent. Idealistic. Brilliant. Hilarious. Shy. And absolutely GORGEOUS. I hit the lottery. We were inseparable and obsessed with one another. As the years went by, we both succeeded in our own right. I started and scaled a business from scratch. She graduated with her career. We went from 2 broke kids with broken down cars, to me with a brand new mercedes and her with a brand new Lexus. We both got hotter the older we got too. She wanted to get married. I wasn’t ready yet. We bickered a lot over nothing and me coming from divorced parents, I was just scared to repeat the cycle. She wasn’t the best communicator. Abusive upbringing. Not her fault. And I was very direct. A bit harsh. Didn’t mean to be. I was always that way. I’ve always been brutally honest. Which she liked about me. Until she didn’t I guess. “Friends” (none of whom were present when we got together), co workers, family all got in her head. She talked about our issues to strangers behind my back while I was hyper focused on work. Completely oblivious to it all. I gave her all the freedom in the world. Trusted her blindly. This was a mistake. Not because she wasn’t trustworthy, but because new experiences and new social circles made her question what we had Society brainwashed us to prioritize success and money over all. This is a mistake. This was MY mistake. It is EMPTY. I miss my best friend. I never cheated or lied or abused or disappeared. Nothing unforgivable. But she had enough of what our relationship had become. I was distant. Took her for granted. I knew I wasn’t going anywhere, so I didn’t think she would. I tried to reconcile for 10 months. Wrote letters. Called. Spoke to parents. I was a wreck. No luck. She got with some other guy right away I think. It’s been a couple years. I regret not proposing. I regret not being PRESENT our last year together. I regret not initiating the hard conversations. I regret not moving away with her to another state. I regret not being more patient. There’s nothing I wouldn’t do to be back with her. She was it for me. The ambition and drive I once had is gone. Nothing makes sense without her. We wanted the same Things. Neither of us wanted kids. We wanted to grow old alongside one another. We helped each other become what we now are. But immaturity from both of us is what did it in. It’s crazy how fragile true love can be. How irreparable it can be once it breaks. And how rare it is for us to get it. Now I’m stuck here for another 40 years doomed to mediocrity. Anyone else after her will be second best. Such a good thing and so short lived. 70-80 year life span, and I was only afforded a PREVIEW at what joy could be for 6 years. She was so weird too. Had this little dance she did when she ate. She made weird noises. She’d fall asleep anywhere on top of anything. She was always so happy and excited for no reason. She’d look for me the moment she woke up. She knew me inside and out. She accepted me just as I was. And I messed it all up. We both did, but I know had I done MY part we wouldve been fine. Guys, if there’s a girl you’re crazy about, just marry her. Figure the rest out later. Don’t be me. I’ve lost my hair. My beard is greying. I see no hope. No optimism. No light at the end of the tunnel. No reason to stick around. Life is short. Not all of us find our person. If u find yours. Make it count. She won’t stay. Don’t get comfortable. Women are not like men. U MUST keep the romance alive. Every day. Forever. People tell me “you’re tall, you’re handsome, you’re intelligent, you’re In shape, you have a lot to offer!!”. Maybe. But I only want one person. I wanted her before I even met her. And now I have to live with never being with her again.",anonym22213,https://old.reddit.com/r/regret/comments/mboz8p/lost_the_love_of_my_life/

She screamed for help from the neighbors. It happened around 4 am. I was in the living room until 3:49am. I went up and stayed up til 4:30 and had my earphones on full volume. Wwhat happened was the only neighbor awake at the time getting his car ready refused to bring the kid to the hospital (bc he had a ""biking meet up) and instead went to knock on another neighbors door (who's car was parked far away). I regret not laying down on the sofa for an extra 15 minutes. I would've heard her screams and woke up my dad. I couldve done cpr while my dad backed the car up since they were one house down from ours. So many things our community could've done. It took them 20 minutes to bring him to the hospital that was 2 minutes away from our subdivision. Hearing the mom's screams when his body was brought back by the funeral home had me crying.

regret,My dad is a angry hermit that pushed everyone who cared about him away. I thought I was different until today (self.regret),"The last thing my father said to me was that I was a “Godless psychopath” and he blamed me for his marriage falling apart. That was back in 2013. Needless we don’t speak anymore. My mom left him he got forced into early retirement and lives alone in a disgusting house and spends all day on Twitter and Facebook “owning the libs.” He has no friends and is anti vaccine Q conspiracists and the most sexist person I have ever known. He still hates people that bullied him when he was kid. I honestly think the only reason he is a Christian is that he likes the idea of everyone who wronged him burning in hell. I don’t hate women I don’t spend all day on social media but today I realized I push people away like he does and I hold grudges just like him and I am very alone. I worked for a company that got bought out by another company. They told us it was a merger. That was a lie. My job got harder and there are somethings that are objectively worse, but there were some good things. That was over two years ago. I let my anger blind me and just shoved it down. I would exercise a crazy amount 4 hours plus a day. I thought it was helping but all it did was distract me from my feelings. Eventually it all boiled over and I was getting angrier and angrier. My manager extended an olive branch and tried to help but I shut her out and insisted that everything was fine. Well eventually my anger boiled over and I quit. I put in my notice and was extremely brutal in my exit interview. I said that this was the worst company on the planet and that I could not be happier to leave. Well even with all that the people I trashed were sad to see me go. I got so many heartfelt messages, even from people I trashed, saying they would miss me. A few people even cried.

regret,Sexual Abuse (self.regret),"Basically when I was 12-16/17yrs old I was sexually abused by my “stepdad”.

Recently I’ve been thinking about it and I really regret sending nudes to all those people.

regret,I regret running away from home (self.regret),"I'm 25M, when I was about 13 me and my dad got in an arguement and he punched me and I punched him back. I was fuming and my mum put me in my room. My mum was quite ill and she put the lock on the room to keep me in the house. I some how convinced her to open the door and I ran out. I still remember her face as she waited by our front door and I was down the street looking back. I did eventually come home after 2 weeks of staying in the park and sleeping over at friends. But when I did her illness got worse, she became non-verbal and in a matter of days all brain function stoped and she died. I wish I didn't put her through that and I hate that I made her upset so close to her death",ma_nek_ma_bak_ma_pus,https://old.reddit.com/r/regret/comments/vfzxj6/i_regret_running_away_from_home/
regret,Missed my last chance (self.regret),"I’ve held onto this for a while and have discussed it with loved ones but I know I will hold onto this regret for the rest of my life. I had a really close friend who was living out of town finishing his degree so I only got the chance to see him when he was in town to see his family, which wasn’t that infrequent. He was one of my absolute favorite people but we were in a kind of weird place due to a tifu level incident in which I sent him a nude on Snapchat meant for my boyfriend. Knowing he had feelings for me in the past I wanted to back off and give him space and honestly I just felt really awkward and guilty. We started hanging out less just the two of us, and usually saw each other with mutual friends. About a year ago I was in a place where I was really depressed and got extreme anxiety from interacting with anyone I didn’t see on a daily basis. He texted me saying he would be in town for a long weekend and wanted to get together. Due to anxiety, it took me a couple days to respond to him. I sent a text apologizing, letting him know I wanted to see him but was just struggling a lot with depression and anxiety, and asking if there was any chance he was in town long enough to hang out. The text showed up as green (meaning it couldn’t get through as an iMessage), which struck me as a little odd, until a couple hours later when I got a group text from a mutual friend saying “is it true what happened to [friend]?” My heart absolutely sunk. I immediately went on his Facebook page and discovered that he had gotten in a head-on collision with a semi on his way back to school earlier that day and had passed away. He was the first and only friend I’ve ever lost and it was so difficult in so many ways. Initially, all I could think was “I could have seen him”...If I wasn’t so crippled by anxiety I could have just texted him back right away and been in his presence, heard his laugh, let him tease me for overthinking everything and being crazy, listened to his blunt advice and reassurance. But even worse was that stupid green text hanging over my head. If I had just sent it the day before or a little sooner, he could’ve read it and known that I wasn’t just blowing him off. I might’ve had the opportunity to tell him how important he was to me, how much I truly did want to spend time with him. Every time I go over this in my head I hear how I think he would have responded. He would laugh at the notion I had anything to feel guilty about. He would tell me I was being silly and make sure I knew it wasn’t a big deal and he didn’t take it personally and say he knew me too well to expect good communications anyways. But he’s not here anymore and nothing I tell myself will bring that time back. Thanks for reading if you did. I’m not expecting any response in particular I just needed a neutral place to vent.",HaringBone,https://old.reddit.com/r/regret/comments/l9nk5d/missed_my_last_chance/
regret,Today I did a good deed and instantly regretted it. (self.regret),"I was at the supermarket in the middle of a grocery shop with my daughter when a man approached me asking if I could buy him body wash. I told him that I was paying for my shop with my card and that I could pay for it with my shop once I was done. He replied by saying “you could just do it now”. I felt very intimidated at this point and stupidly did what he wanted and paid for it at the self checkouts. It was $12 and thought wow I don’t even buy something full price like this for myself only when it’s on special but I paid for it anyway. As soon as I paid for it he proceeded to ask “do you have any change?” Probably noticing my $10 note as I was putting my card back into my wallet. I said “no sorry I need it” and said “this is yours” as I handed over the body wash. He walked off, not even a thank you. I instantly regretted it. So greedy and ungrateful. I feel so stupid and can’t stop thinking about it.

regret,My biggest regret (self.regret),"A few years back, I was 23 at the time, my mom had been diagnosed with and started treatment for cancer. She decided to do just chemo. A few days after the infusions she got hit HARD by the aftermath. I'm not physically strong. My mother was obese and very weak from the chemo. My older brother and I were the ones to take care of her. It got to the point where she couldn't handle the 3 feet from bed to commode. One day she was sleeping and talking a bunch of nonsense. Like she wanted me to bake apple turnovers or some shit. Kinda funny. Anyway later on she fell again one day because she had to use the commode. When she fell she ended up not being able to get back up and she urinated and defecate on herself. I cleaned her up as best I could. Not long after she needed to go to the hospital again because she was in pain. From that hospital she was transported to another in Columbus Ohio. The James to be specific. While there she got worse. I was ill suited to the task of being a caregiver. I think I still am. I just don't have the heart to do stuff life that. That's one of the regrets that I do have. Not being able to care for her better. But back to the main story. I didn't know how to care for her. Nurses would take care of her mostly. There were times there when I'd wonder around and find something to do. Not long after my mom was admitted to hospice care where she'd eventually pass. My biggest regret in my short time on this rock is not being there to say goodbye to her one last time. I miss my mom. It's been almost 2 years since she passed. And I still miss her.",1ansane1nthemembrane,https://old.reddit.com/r/regret/comments/o2i4k8/my_biggest_regret/
regret,Not moving into my Grandmothers old place when I had the chance (self.regret),A few years back my grandmother(then late 90’s now deceased) moved in with my parents. While I was helping them move her things out they asked If I wanted to move in. Grandma had a beautiful house. Just out of a little village about 15-20 minutes drive from my job up hill from a local beach. The steep hill gave her place an excellent feeling of privacy. She had an immaculately kept garden that often had Kangaroos lounging around in it. Not to mention it was full of fond childhood memories to me. My first impulse and the answer I really wanted to give was HELL YES but then a little voice in my head said be reasonable. Sure you work full time but conservatively this place is worth at least 6 times what your little two bedroom unit is. However they want to do this be it rent or parental mortgage you can’t afford the place. What’s more you are a slob. You’d never keep this place clean let alone maintain the garden. Reluctantly I answered my parents not no but instead “you don’t want me living here” They ended up selling the place. To this day the algebra remains the same it’s still just as impractical but I still wish I’d said fuck it yes.,Vexra,https://old.reddit.com/r/regret/comments/nfwiqs/not_moving_into_my_grandmothers_old_place_when_i/

regret,Not finishing school. (self.regret),"I messed up so bad. I only have the most basic education that was obligatory. As a kid all i wanted was to not wake up the next day. I honestly thought that i will not make it to my 18th birthday. I didn't see the point in it all. School just made it worse. The constant noise, kids running around, blinking lights.. It made me want to just die. Later on i found out i had autism, but no one wanted to tell me or the teachers that to make school more bearable. I dropped out of one school and then another one, finally ending on an online school. It was actually calm there, but i didn't try anymore. I just spend the whole day inside watching the cieling. I wish i would have tried and gotten actually better grades. I know i could've have. I regret thinking nothing matters and i shouldn't try. I had a chance to keep going with that school and get higher education, but i didn't. I just spent years inside. I don't know what changed, but i slowly started to revover. After few failed attempts i started trying to get rid of my depression and despite all my doubts it got better. So much so that i got some jobs, gained skills on my hobbies and for the first time in years saw a future for myself. But i had no education and my grades were bad. I tried to apply to schools, but they wouldn't take me. The online school where i used to go - now nonexistent. I wish i did better. Education is important. I know that. I never hated it.

regret,BIG REGRET (self.regret),Not to long ago maybe 2 years ago I would say the N word all the time (im white btw). I knew that it was fucked and said it anyway and I have no idea why I was just being stupid and ignorant. Until around last year someone took a screenshot of me saying it in a snapchat and sent it to people. It wasn't many just acquaintances that I knew of. I kind of shrugged it off and nothing big really happened. But then one person got ahold of it soon after and didn't really mind much then. So around a month ago I really started to regret it. Sure you can call it regret that I got caught using such an offense word. Now I never really used it in a way that would hurt anyone but I should have never said it in the first place. I have no excuses to make. I haven't said it at all since then but I am still worried if it were to get out what might happen to my future if it were to get out or anything. So I would really like your opinion in the comments about it. If you stayed and read this I sincerely thank you.

regret,Pushing away the only woman who TRULY Loved me for who I am (gone hoirribly wrong ) PLEASE READ (self.regret),"There was a girl that I really liked. At the time I had an online gf and she had a boyfriend. We were both having relationship issues and we would talk about it alot. We hungout alot as friends (went to the gym and worked t the same place) we slowly started to fall for eachother. She loved me to the point she put notes in my bag saying ""Hey (My name) I love you, Lets smoke weed next Sat <3"" she put notes almost everyday in my bag after work. I got reckless and confessed my feelings. She still wanted to be friends but after that I started avoiding her and said shitty things to her out of jealousy for being with her current boyfriend still. She cut me off her life. A few weeks later she found out her boyfriend cheated on her. She msged me and asked if i wanted to be friends with her again and I accepted... But something about her changed. Despite her saying that we were friends again she was treating me like shit. it felt like she still didnt forgive me for ssaying shitty things to her and ignoring her.... She started only dating guys who were rich. She wasnt the same anymore she only dated guys for money. She said she would be friends with me but the way she was behaving and avoiding me was telling me something else. She became cold and honestly it felt like she wasnt even the same person anymore. Before she was such a cheery and lighthearted girl who loved spending time with me because she loved me for who I am and the crazy similarities we had. But now she became a girl who started to use guys for money by having sex with them. She cut me off from her life again. She started doing hard drugs as well and went to the hospital. At this point, I realized things have changed. The love that she once gave me was gone. Shes gone insane and apart of me felt like it was all my fault. If theres anything I learned from this. Its that you should never take people for granted. Never say hurtful things because it can cause an unexpected turn in there life. From a girl who was caring and loving to a girl who started to become cold and only use people for her own good. Crazy how the people who u are close to the most can turn your life in to hell. (In her case it was me but not anymore) I regret this so much. Never again will I do this to anyone. I lost someone who loved me deeply... And I have been regretting everyday for 3 years...

regret,I let depression destroy my future. I regret it. (self.regret),"When I was 13 I lost my dad. After that, I figured out that no one in my family really cared all that much about me. Mom sent me away one summer to be locked up in juvenile detention for the entire summer so she could date alone and not have me at the house. My sister always hated me so she made things worse by talking my mom into doing things that hurt or hindered me in life. Things were a little better after my sister died, I kind of hate to say that and feel relief from it. I spent most of my time alone and my adult years weren't much better. Depression was always there. Held be back. Made solving problems almost impossible. When I was 25 I met the most perfect girl ever. I fell hard in love with her. I held back asking her out because I felt like with all my problems I couldn't provide a good life for her. But I decided that I needed to ask her out. We hung out all the time. She seemed interested, and might as well try because I knew I would regret it if I didn't. The very day I was going to ask her out. The next morning in fact. She told me she had started dating my best friend at the time. I couldn't be upset at them about it. I told no one about how I felt. I swallowed my heart and congratulated them. They dated for a few months and moved in together. I didn't talk to either of them as much. I just told myself I had to move on. I had my chance and blew it. He dumped her one day and she moved away. About 800 miles away. I didn't hear from her again for well over a decade. I tried to date other women. Thinking I would find the perfect one out there. Each girlfriend was worst than that last. Usually a bait and switch kind of situation. I was falsely accused of rape at one point. Spent the night in jail. Thankfully she admitted it was a lie and they let me go. The last straw for me was my last girlfriend. I asked her to marry me. She not long after that she was pregnant. I was going to be a dad and married. I was happy for once in a long time. My mom got sick and while she was dying in the hospital, my girlfriend at the time was cheating on me. Nowhere to be found the day my mom died. Eventually, I found out when the guy's she cheated on me with wife spray painted my ex's car when she found it in the driveway of their house. She aborted our child and then acted like none of it was a big deal. I gave a eulogy to a bunch of empty chairs. It hit me hard how alone I was in this world. I just pretended my mom could still hear me. That was over 10 years ago and I haven't dated ever since. I feel like I'm too old to start a family now. I'd be in my 70s now when a child I had today would finish high school. I reached out to my old friend a few years back. Told her all that had happened and how I felt about her back then. She has a family now. A beautiful little girl and a little boy are both so very smart for their age. She gave me the kindest words. And she died today. I march on alone now. Making my way to the end. I regret not asking her out sooner. I regret letting depression hold me back.",throwaway4hundred4,https://old.reddit.com/r/regret/comments/raobus/i_let_depression_destroy_my_future_i_regret_it/

Eyeglasses, slightly tomboyish, etc. Me, being a comics/animation nerd myself, struck a conversation with her. She was very passionate about the subject. She had a very cute laugh. But.... at the time (I was 21) I was obsessed, for lack of a better word, with the ""perfect"" girl. So, I didn't follow up. I thought she was too ""nerdy"". Me, a nerd myself! Can you say ""young and stupid""? I had buried this in my mind for a long time, but recently, it has resurfaced with a vengeance. Had I become more involved with her, God only knows what kind of relationship could have developed. And, even if we didn't ultimately end up together, at least I would have had that life experience. But I was so blind. Now, decades later, I'm still single, and still looking for a mate, though not the ""perfect"" woman as they don't exist. All I'm left now with is just wishing her happiness, wherever she might be, whether she is with someone or by herself.

regret,I regret burning so many bridges and shutting out friends I'd known since elementary school... (self.regret),"I'm not even sure why I acted out the way I did. It was after my first breakup but that wasn't really the issue. You see I begun dating when I started college, it was a girl I'd gone to highschool with but no ever talked to her than but she was a mutual friend of someone I'd known all throughout high school. He had a girlfriend he'd eventually go on to marry and the four of us hung out a lot. I kind of didn't really want to date this girl at first because her life was a mess at the time, it was bad timing and that's not on her. Maybe we both felt pressured since our friends were a couple I don't know... But we dated for a while and when we broke up I kind of felt unwelcome in the group. But I wasn't mad at her at all. Kind of weird, I know. But I mostly lashed out at my old friend more than anything, but I was generally pretty bitter with everyone. After almost a year and I'm actually in a new relationship, I felt like things could be mended with my friendship but no... I'd done too much damage and he just wasn't interested in talking anymore. He blocked me across most platforms. It was justified. I'd also spiraled out of school and really fucked up my life in general. I guess the pressures of school along with a lot of self destructive behaviors I'd come off as a complete lunatic for like eight months. Over time more and more old friends just dropped off, nothing or as obvious as that one burnt bridge. Just people not responding. Most friendships since have not felt as authentic or deep as the original friends I'd known for years and had gone through so much with. I regret a lot of things. This is just one of the biggest ones. Maybe even the biggest one. I have dreams with this one exfriend where they're actively avoiding me or chastising me for my shitty behavior. I don't feel like I deserve any friends at this point and often times if I meet someone who seem like they might want to know me, I shut them down.

ShameGuilt,Massive guilt after son lost eye (self.ShameGuilt),"Im hoping to get some advice of parents that have harmed their children and how they cope with guilt. I'm struggling with massive guilt and regret since my child lost his eye due to an internal eye infection (endophthalmitis) on February 2017 when he was 2 and a half years old. Long story short, he woke up one Sunday morning with a red painful eye. I gave him antibiotic drops and waited till the next day to take him to the ophthalmologist. Doctors initially misdiagnosed the infection as an autoimmune disorder, so removed antibiotics. After 3 weeks in hospital, we were told that his retina was destroyed due to Staphylococcus infection. They justified themselves saying that they never suspect endophthalmitis (internal infection of the eye) unless there has been previous surgery or penetrating eye trauma. When doctors asked about eye trauma, i initially said he hadn't had any, he had gone fine to bed on Saturday night and woke up with a red painful eye. I was thinking about major trauma. But i mentioned that initially I thought he might have scratched himself during sleep. Some days later I mentioned that i wasn't sure if i had poked him in the eye, but that he hadn't complained. Doctors said a fingernail couldn’t be the cause. I think what happened was that my son had a corneal penetration caused by my fingernail. A few days before he woke up with a red eye (I don’t remember how many), I accidentally poked my kid in the left eye with a broken and dirty fingernail while he was in his high chair. I had picked my nose just before poking him in the eye, and was on my way to clean hands. I was a nasal carrier of the same bacteria that infected my son's eye (doctors got me and my husband tested). My son rubbed his eye after the poking, but didn't cry. First thing I thought after poking him was that I had scratched his eye, introduced my snot into his eye, and he would have an infection. I told my husband I’m afraid that I have scratched his eye, but he told me that he seemed fine, that having an eye scratched is extremely painful (we both have had corneal scratches in the past), and that if I had scratched him he would be crying. I didn't think too much about it after that. my husband told me he maybe closed his eyelid before the impact. I didn’t look properly nor did I cleaned his eye with water or saline. However I felt my finger touching his eye, and afterwards I thought I saw something transparent in my kid's eye, but I didn't check properly. I thought it may be my snot, and that it would get out on its own. I'm so ashamed and regret my decision every day. I don't know exactly when this happened, or how close it was to the day that my son woke up with a painful eye. It may have been a few days before or up to a week before I think. I know now internal infection of the eye can start weeks after initial eye injury, and that eye injuries can be asymptomatic, especially in small children.

ShameGuilt,How do I overcome the guilt and become a better person? (self.ShameGuilt),"I had betrayed trust, I was completely manipulative, my ego and immaturity contributed to my actions, and I deeply regret the choices I made. I've taken the time to reflect and become aware of everything I did wrong, and I genuinely wish I had handled things in a more mature and considerate way. Now, I feel overwhelmed with guilt, and it's hard to shake off the shame of my actions. I want to move forward, but I'm stuck wondering how to truly overcome this guilt and become a better person. How do I learn from this and make sure I don't repeat these behaviors? I want to rebuild trust, not just with others, but with myself, because I know I'm capable of being better than this.",NoReporter2768,https://old.reddit.com/r/ShameGuilt/comments/1ias90g/how_do_i_overcome_the_guilt_and_become_a_better/
ShameGuilt,Buckets full… (self.ShameGuilt),"I am an ex heroin user, got clean for a long time and even became a substance counselor myself eventually. Problem was, I allowed THAT (being a drug counselor, talking about drugs/solutions, etc) to kind of overwhelm me. When taking on others problems, I think it’s important to have someone in your own life to balance things off of when they’re are heavy days. I did non of the things required of me to remain clean/sober for myself. I would tell others “pick up the phone, call someone, hit a meeting”. But never did it myself because I was using my job/position as my crutch. Fast forward to today: I am currently WD from opiates at my parents home. Won’t go into extreme detail but, here i am. Again. Not only that, I’ve let my kids down. Once I got clean and was Two years in I thought “you got this bro” (worst things an addict can tell himself) and PROMISED I was done, I’ll never miss another bday/holiday being locked up or in a rehab. Yet, here I am seriously considering it. I try not to hate myself, it doesn’t help. It just falls on deaf ears. Idk. Thanks for listening. All I can do is try again, I suppose. And make the necessary moves to do as good as possible. “Burn the boats” and give myself no other option but to overcome and try again.

ShameGuilt,Guilt after fatal accident (self.ShameGuilt),"I'm sorry if this is written wrong, I don't really understand reddit and got this account just to ask this question. I was first on-scene of a major motorcycle accident that happened right in front of me. I was trained in first aid and CPR and such from years in the military, and I ran over to see if I could help. The guy was so mangled I didn't know what to do - I couldn't check his airway cause he was in a helmet and all sorts of stuff, his chest looked completely flattened and his arms and legs were all over the place - I was just overwhelmed and wasn't sure of the right way to help. I got the other person from the accident - a car driver, over to the side of the road and directed traffic to help get police into the scene. As soon as they got there they started giving CPR. I just immediately felt terrible - why didn't I do that? The guy died and now I can't stop feeling guilty for not giving CPR immediately. Anyone ever go through anything like that? I guess now I know just do CPR right away and don't worry about all the other stuff, but I feel like someone had to die for me to learn that lesson. EDIT - I also feel guilty for feeling guilty.

ShameGuilt,random guilt and shame throughout the day (self.ShameGuilt),"hi reddit. anyone else get pangs of guilt and shame from minor issues, or even from things that happened years ago? i’m generally a self aware person. i try very hard to self analyze, learn from my mistakes and be my best self. when i catch myself ruminating i can sometimes take a step back and tell myself things like; “it’s okay if you miscommunicated in that moment”, or “no one else is thinking about this” or “you were younger then, and you’ve changed since then”, but for some reason it’s impossible to forgive myself for anything ranging from a tense/awkward moment to a time where i actually didn’t behave well and needed to learn a lesson. i just want to move forward with life and be in my head less. i am also chronically exhausted and am wondering if maybe this is depression, or even an attachment disorder. i am a very normal person, and for the most part i am happy. i can hold down a full time job. i have hobbies, several close friendships. im in a very loving relationship. im an extrovert but in many ways try to fly under the radar because of this guilt/shame/hyper awareness i feel. i struggle to post on social media platforms and avoid it entirely because of this. does this relate to anyone?",Relevant_Path_845,https://old.reddit.com/r/ShameGuilt/comments/1jwa7wh/random_guilt_and_shame_throughout_the_day/

The most recent one tho was last night. Not only did I piss in this guys bed twice while drunk he decided to give me another chance and instead of redeeming myself he said I got mad at something he said, cursed him out, tried walking home alone half naked, was sloppily talking to his aunt and sister while sluring my words and it was clear they were very uninterested in what I had to say, and he ended it off w saying I can never come over again. Ofc I have no recollection of anything I only know because he was kind enough to answer the phone the next day and lmk what happened. I’m disgusted and disappointed w myself. I’m done drinking for good so the good thing is nothing like this can ever happen again… however I can’t seem to shake this intense feeling of guilt and shame for my behavior. I just keep thinking about how he and his family and mine perceive me. The memories are literally haunting me. I’ve gotten arrested, had multiple car accidents, and ruined so many relationships. My mom hates me and thinks I’m a bum, whore, and hopeless. People have went on “tea pages” and wrote absolutely horrible things about me so it’s not just him that now have these opinions but a lot of people. I promise I’m a good person.

ShameGuilt,Just did something gross (self.ShameGuilt),"I happened to be a porn addict, it was all gone some moths ago, I was really clean but lust won over a celibacy time I was doing, it was 40 days clean and I started talking to girls compulsively and stuff. On Telegram there were groups of men who sahre pictures of their wife and I was so tempted to ask for those, I was feeling guilty about it but most of the time I asked to the men if their partner knew about sharing her images and 100% of the answers were a no. So I stopped and told them they must stop if its not mutual, that they shouldn't share that without permission while being full of lust at the same time, but that is my rational mind talking, not my lustful mind who was willing to ask for those photos to many dudes willing to share their couple and of course I enjoyed them, but the other part of my psyche was giving the advise to those men. Idk why it seems when you got controled by lust or anger you are another completly different person, I feel really bad and guilty, plus I have OCD so my mind gets worse about it. Any advise?

ShameGuilt,I'll never forgive myself for not letting my mom move in with me 2 days before she died. (self.ShameGuilt),"My mom had severe schizoaffective disorder, which made her difficult to handle or talk to for more than a few hours, but she was a nice, lovely woman who loved her two boys with all her heart and would have given you everything she had if she liked you. I was living with my grandmother at the time because she was dealing with the recent loss of my grandfather, we lived right below my mom, you could easily have a conversation from the two houses porches the houses were that close. Mom had come to visit and spend some time with me like she always did every day and she said she missed me living with her and asked if she could move in with us. I told her I'd talk to my grandmother and we'd think about it, but I had no intention of having her move in because of how hard she was to deal with with her mental disability. 2 days later I heard popping noises so I looked out the window only to see moms house lit ablaze. When I got to the porch I knew that if mom was still in there, there was no way I could have saved her. I know her death wasn't my fault, you can't predict the future and nobody knew her electrical heater would malfunction, but it doesn't change the fact that if I had said yes to her moving in, she would be still here with me. She was my best friend, my rock, and now she's gone and the guilt of lying to her is eating me alive. It's been 7 years now and I just can't forgive myself.

So i free him (feeling like literal shit ive never hurt anyone to this degree) and he starts running around and telling me its not my fault. Like of course it is my fault friend! So he sits on the ground and takes his shoe off n say fuck its wet (insinuating tht he was bleeding). When he took his sock off his toenail went with it. My heart sunk into my fucking ass and my head was over fuelled with self depricating comments. The guy is fine he is making jokes saying its his fault and im just speechless and I walk away and jus stare blankly and water is just pouring from my eyes. Not because im sad but because im so careless and im cryinf with an intact toe nail so why the fuck should i be crying.

ShameGuilt,I was a bad son (self.ShameGuilt),My mother died from cancer a few years ago and sometimes the guilt and desire to see her again hit me out of nowhere. I would like to apologize because for a few years before she got sick I wouldn't talk to her much just because I would spend all day watching TV in another room and then when she got sick I didn't do much to help. When she finally died I couldn't bring myself to see her before the end. Just a little while ago I saw a comic where I person wished to go back in time so that they could stop their parents from getting married because they knew their mother would be better off without them and I found myself relating a lot.

ShameGuilt,Books on shame and guilt (recommend your own) (self.ShameGuilt),"What are some books on shame and guilt you have found useful? Feel free to share anything that worked for you personally. I made this post a while back but deleted it and reposting it now as a pinned post, so it can get more responses. Shame and guilt overlap. They also overlap with many other concepts. So, to find a good book, it may help to widen your circle of search. For example, to learn more about shame, you may want to look at books that discuss vulnerability, perfectionism, feelings of worthlessness, etc. While there are books that directly discuss psychological research on shame, you might feel a stronger emotional connection to a book that is seemingly about something else, such as trauma or addiction, yet really about shame. In general, guilt seems easier to understand and explain. For example, when you feel guilty, you try to do something about it, so it does not prevent you from connecting with others and with life. Not so with shame. Shame is often (not always) more painful, goes deeper into you, affects your identity and whole being, and makes you want to hide and disappear. It silences you. In terms of books, to understand guilt, I suggest you take a look at religious books (and those on philosophy of religion). For shame, I suggest you take a look here: Brené Brown's books, such as The Gifts of Imperfection. Tangney's Shame and Guilt (a bit more on the academic side). Bradshaw's Healing the Shame that Binds You (a classic). Suggest yours.",henrygatz,https://old.reddit.com/r/ShameGuilt/comments/1k513ok/books_on_shame_and_guilt_recommend_your_own/
ShameGuilt,Shame from the past coming up. Can’t sleep. (self.ShameGuilt),"Update: I told my mom about it this morning for the first time. She still accepts me and loves me despite it. That was huge. She said I don’t have to feel as bad about it as I do. I also reached out to my step-cousin. I don’t know how that will go. When I was in my early twenties I had a sexual relationship with my step-cousin of the same age. No one in the family found out as far as I know. I feel so much shame and guilt about it. It was weird. It was gross. It was taboo. He isn’t even a good person. We were surrounded by a very weird situation at the time. His mom married my uncle. They each had kids from previous marriages. That’s why he’s not my actual blood cousin. One of his sister’s ended up marrying one of my uncle’s sons. I don’t remember if the step siblings were dating before my uncle and his mom got together. I think that might have been the case. It was very strange. So my step-cousin and I were surrounded by people who decided to blur these family lines. We grew up with it. I think that’s why we thought it was OK. I remember literally saying that very thing when we started fooling around. As in “so and so did it so why can’t we?” He wanted to have PIV sex and I never allowed it. I’m so glad I didn’t, but I still feel so much shame and guilt for what we did do. I feel like I’m supposed to be a better person than that. I ended up ending it once I realized how wrong it was and kept that boundary. He tried to make moves on me a couple more times after that and I refused. Now it’s almost 20 years later and I feel so much shame and guilt. I hope writing this helps. I couldn’t sleep last night.

ShameGuilt,Lost my friends on discord due to being stupid (self.ShameGuilt),"This hurts still too this day, but for a while I was lonely and found this discord server called sports heaven. I made many friends over it thoughout the past 2 years. Fast forward to July of 2023 I made a server and me and my friends had good times. One of my good friends was a Jewish girl who I was a bit close with. Fast forward to November of 2024 things were going good until I joke banned a friend. Then people started leaving so I transferred ownership to another friends. People were getting fed up with me. When I came back to discord after a break things were not the same. He completley changed everything and I felt like I wasn't needed much. I took a break but everyone got pissed cause I kept leaving. Two weeks in I joined back and I still felt that way. Little did I know the worst was about to come. Two weeks from this it felt like things were getting better, then me and the Jewish person got into an argument. It calmed down but then someone mentioned the idea of someone making a hitler alt. The reason why is they mention hitler in casual jokes like calling players him when they messed up. That brings me to what I did. I made another account titled Adolph hitler and imitated him. It was only to play around, but I said some fucked shit on it. ""I hate Jews"". ""Shut up Jews"". ""I want to build my aryan race."" It was all meant to be playing around but I harrased someone who I knew had family from the holocaust. Then the owner banned me after I admitted to it. Safe to say I've hated myself a lot for this. I knew better at the time this was wrong. I tried apologizing but they didn't take it seriously. I actually had one of my friends on Imessage and he was sending them screenshots of our convo. Reason is to make me look like I was guilt tripping. That reason being cause I banned him for being than unbanned him after giving him a second chance. (Those same people told me to and the person who I harassed was also trans too). I tried dmming one of the mods apologizing but he took it on me to say I was guilt tripping and he thought I was dmming him cause he was clueless. He sent everything to the staff chat there and I got cooked. Then the guy imessaged me all the problems he had with me and didn't seem sorry for being transphobic. As well as that he was being a jerk about nfl predicitions flexing that he was right and that I was in the wrong despite him saying I was dumb for my predictions. He even tried making me feel worse trying to get joy out of me being broken. I also got bullied for this as well by these same people. Now they call me hitler and stuff and I hate it. Recently to get him back I imessaged him something mean. He said kys, youre worthless you will always be known for being sad etc. And he gave my number to a random person to dm me that other people were calling me hitler. Since then I haven't talked really to any of them. I fucked up bad and wish I could have it back. I feel like the worst person in the world and I understand it's an app, but I still hurt someone at the end of the day. I luckily have irl friends and am in a frat. That's keeping me up. And a lot of things are reminding me of this like not being able to talk march madness etc. I understand it's an app but I hurt people and it's hard to forgive or look at myself the same and not feel horrid. I did get what I deserved and I just have a hard time not thinking about this. I wish I could make it up to them but I can't. It sucks as well knowing they're probably saying these hurtful things behind my back. Yes I put it on myself but it sucks. Feels like now everyone is going to think the memories of 2 years are nothing. To any Jewish person I apologize as well I'm not a bigot or a nazi, I fucked up and made a horrid joke which I shouldn't have done. I will admit the guy who I was imessaging said it's hard to defend me yet there was another guy in there who insulted my dead grandma who he defended, saying that he apologized, when I called him out for harassing me after I unbanned him. It's a bit odd but it doesn't justify what I did and either way it's still hard to defend my actions. Also I'm not saying that one action is worse than the other. Anyways I need advice just cause I get memories when I didn't have to deal with this or being affiliated with one of the worse people to ever exist. Cause it's difficult to move on knowing what I said and people are saying and think these things about me and places where I was once loved and one I created. I doubt I'll be forgiven and my account is deleted. I try to forgive myself but I can't cause this was all in my control. If anyone can give me advice please that would be helpful. It's also hard to live knowing that people may think about this forever. I mainly ask how do I deal with the pain of this. It's hard to look at myself the same really. I feel terrible.",Queasy_Elevator_8184,https://old.reddit.com/r/ShameGuilt/comments/1jie04q/lost_my_friends_on_discord_due_to_being_stupid/
ShameGuilt,I think deep inside I do not want to let go of guilt (self.ShameGuilt),"I've been grappling with intense feelings of guilt for more than a year now—mostly about the things I said, as well as the things I did and didn't do. These are things I can no longer make amends for now. I feel like these are things that cannot be forgiven. Or maybe I feel this way because I tend to not forgive and hold grudges against others, so it's hard for me to forgive myself as well. I've been looking at this sub and other subs on how to ""live with guilt"" and noticed that I would skip posts that tackle how to ""let go of guilt"" or ""forgive oneself,"" as if it's my plan to carry this guilt for the rest of my life. I feel like carrying this guilt is my punishment, my atonement. And yet, I also know that if I do not heal, I won't have healthy relationships with other people.",schrodingerscat15,https://old.reddit.com/r/ShameGuilt/comments/1jgm431/i_think_deep_inside_i_do_not_want_to_let_go_of/

ShameGuilt,I got caught shoplifting at a supermarket and i think im getting paranoid (self.ShameGuilt),"To give you some context. Im a well off teenager living in Brazil haven’t struggled with money or anything my entire life. About a year ago I developed a addiction to shoplifting, it started with really small things like gum and candy, but it started escalating from the start of 2024. It turned into grabbing full pieces of steak, imported goods and larger stuff such as notebooks and school materials like those blue german pencils for drawing. Since I never got caught I started to think I was untouchable, literally a ghost. That brings us to last Saturday. I was planning on making a nice dinner to my friends because I haven’t seen them in a while, the only problem was that i had already spent a good part pf my allowance on other stuff and didn’t have enough money to buy everything (even though they would help with paying the ingredients I usually buy the stuff ahead and they transfer me after i buy everything). Then my very smooth caveman businessman brain thought if I shoplift everything I need everyone will think I bought it, and they will transfer the money anyway and I will thrive once again. Mind you i needed two packs of risotto rice, a block of Parmesan, a block of brie, and about 4 kilos of ossobuco (I think you guys call it beef shank). Well I went to the closest grocery store which was inside a shopping mall and I’ve did it many times before there, just with much smaller hauls. I got everything that I needed shoved it inside a backpack thinking I was really sneaky while doing so (mind you I such a pussy I start trembling when I do stuff like this and it gets pretty obvious) and as I leave the grocery store a security guy pulls me aside and tells me to empty the backpack inside a shopping cart and wait because the manager of the store was coming (At that moment my world fell apart because all the guilt of all the stuff i lifted until this point fell onto my shoulders and I gad to hold really hard not to cry). Out the store comes the manager, he asks me questions about why I did it and i answered them truthfully, he then called the mall security team to come look at the situation. Once there the security called one of the security managers which came down from his office and started speaking with me (These guys are from a third party company that answers directly to the police so I really thought I was done for). The guy was accompanied by a lady both of them wearing suits with earpieces and small dashcams, they were really calm and collected when dealing with me. They asked if I have any record in the police and I answered that I didn’t (and i really don’t). They then started asking about what I do. And I said that im studying to take an admissions test to a medical school. They lectured me on how wrong this is and absurdly dumb I am for doing this and how only a single shoplifting record could ruin my whole life and the deeper they went the more guilty I was feeling. After some time they said that they’d give me another chance only writing a local occurrence on the shopping mall security system. Its been 2 days since that happened, and the shame and guilt is eating me from the inside. I keep getting flashbacks of the security guard’s face and how disgusted his expression was. I really feel like I have to honor the decision the security manager made of letting me go unscathed, but at the same time I feels so ashamed that I have difficulty going to the gym because my gym is in the same shopping mall as the grocery store, same hoes to daily activities. Im in class and i get flashbacks. Im eating lunch and i get flashbacks. Its fucking my head up. Just to clarify Im ashamed and im not asking for pity I just feel that i needed to get this off my chest and ask for you guy’s opinions on what can I do to deal with this shame and guilt, im scared guys. I feel like a piece of shit and I can’t rely on anyone but you internet strangers for a different perspective on things.

ShameGuilt,How can i ever forgive myself.. when i made the worst mistake of my life.... (self.ShameGuilt),"Could someone have the patience and time to read this? Is long yes.. but plz plz.. i need opinions plz. (I already tried therapy so no need to say i need it) Tw: depprsion, sxual comments. So 5 months into my relationship with my ex and baby daddy and love of my life H, i started talking to my ex from 10 years ago L, at the time L lived in the US and i lived outside the US, no way to meet or be close etc, H told me to block him prior since L and me would casually talk as friends since before H and i started dating, so, i did but stpid me unblocked him and started talking to L behind H's back, i NEVER talked anything about love or sent pictures or calls to L, it would be casual talk like ""how's life how's family, Christmas etc"" (not trying to justify it was WRONG) still i was STPID enough to erase convos and hide it from H, that was my biggest Fing mistake I ever did in my miserable life, knowing i had everything with H.. idk why i even did it..i was so stpid, H after finding out decided to continue with me, and we moved to the US, there he asked me questions saying ""you have one chance to tell me everything and be honest"" i had already told him everything, but i again explained myself, he cried and those tears klled me, i felt so so bad, evil, like trash, but he told me he ""forgave me"", but he never did and never will, at that point his love for me died and i do not blame him, but he never told me, he continued with me for 2 years, maybe out of pitty or because i would beg or because i always said i didn't wanted to live without him (yes it was a HORRIBLE thing to say) my intention wasn't to manipulate him, i just didn't wanted to lose him..there wasn't A DAY I wouldn't apologize for the whole 2 years of relationship, up until today i would apologize crying... After i got prego my mental health started declining, and he started revenge cheating on me, talking to other girls and having online relationships with them, send them money, gifts, etc. when i gave birth, i had severe Ppd, i would argue a lot asking for him to show more affection and love to me as he got cold, i would have anger issues or would just cry like a baby, one time while drunk i even played around with a knife with him playing like ""if you cheat on me I'll kill you"" (believe me i hate myself i was so dumb here) it was a joke but it was a very stupid thing to do, anyway, he kept cheating until finally he found his current gf and this year on my bday he left me for her, coming home full of love marks on his neck that looked like he was beat up from how dark they were looking like bruises, I've been depressed ever since, i even was scidal and would harm myself, what i thought was a beautiful life together was hell for him.. for the past 5 months he kept saying there was a chance for him to return to me, he would ask for money i'd give it, he would ask for sual stuff through camera I'd do it, all to maybe get him to forgive me and get him back, it got to a point where he said ""everything you have done has been in vain because i say so"" because he thought that whatever he did for me was never enough for me because I'd ask for more, and maybe he was right, but he indeed was enough, more than i deserved honestly, so i decided against my will to cut all ties and communications to heal and to leave him alone, blocked his whtsapp and etc, and i was making progress to heal, it had only been 5 days but i was starting to feel better, until he got into my mobile game account and wrote me there that we had to talk, telling me ""either you reply or else I'm getting tired we have to talk"" so, i messaged him.. and that's when he acted all loving and i was so happy, he would tell me i was beautiful, that he missed me and loved me, and that he wanted to come for 2 days to be with our son to my state and see how I'd treat him and maybe he would stay, i even sent him what he asked for again through videos, i started again saying how i wanted to stare at his beautiful eyes under the light, started being poetic, but if i sent a sorta cold message like a simple ""yes"" he'd start getting mad because i was dry, until he became cold and hostile talking to me like i was a slave and told me the only way to forgive me was if i had a one night stand my ex L and recorded myself to show him, that way he'd instantly forgive me, ignite the love again and be with me have more children etc, which i refused to do.. so everything i had done for the past 5 months became in vain, again, and he said ""you lost your chance you lost me forever"".. and started saying all the things that made me feel guilty again, started saying how he cheated because he had to ""stand me"" for those 2 years after what i had done.. and how it was hell for him.. and again, the 5% healing progress i had made by not having contact came crashing down.. now, i cannot stand the guilt, consuming me, making me feel like a pathetic human being.. i cost my baby a father.. and that makes my guilt 100 times worse.. he's in another state living the happiest life with her looking all healthy and handsome, while i wither away here in guilt.. and me telling myself i deserve every ounce of pain for what i did.. everything going wrong in my life while everything is going right in his..(i deserve it..) i feel like a demon, the worst parasite in the world.... And i will forever suffer without being able to forgive myself.... And even if i forgive myself one day what's the point.. i don't have H anymore by my side.. he will NEVER forgive me anyways.. am i evil? Do i really deserve every bad thing in the world?...

ShameGuilt,Some quotes on shame you may find helpful. Fee free to submit additional ones. (self.ShameGuilt),"“To be shame-bound means that whenever you feel any feeling, need or drive, you immediately feel ashamed. The dynamic core of your human life is grounded in your feelings, needs and drives. When these are bound by shame, you are shamed to the core.” ---------- “Shame is internalized when one is abandoned. Abandonment is the precise term to describe how one loses one’s authentic self and ceases to exist psychologically.” ---------- “Emotions are a form of energy in motion. They signal us of a loss, a threat or a satiation. Sadness is about losing something we cherish. Anger and fear are signal of actual or impending threats to our well-being. Joy signals that we are fulfilled and satisfied.” “Whenever a child is shamed through some form of abandonment, feelings of anger, hurt and sadness arise. Since shame-based parents are shame bound in all their emotions, they cannot tolerate their children’s emotions.” “Therefore, they shame their children’s emotions. When their emotions are shamed, children numb out, so they don’t feel their emotions.” ---------- “When our instinctual life is shamed, the natural core of our life is bound up. It’s like an acorn going through excruciating agony for becoming an oak, or a flower feeling ashamed for blossoming.” ---------- “Toxically shamed people tend to become more and more stagnant as life goes on. They live in a guarded, secretive and defensive way. They try to be more than human (perfect and controlling) or less than human (losing interest in life or stagnated in some addictive behavior).” ---------- “At the deepest level, toxic shame triggers our basic automatic defensive cover-ups. Freud called these automatic cover-ups our primary ego defenses. Once these defenses are in place they function automatically and unconsciously, sending our true and authentic selves into hiding.” “We develop a false identity out of this basic core. We become master impersonators. We avoid our core agony and pain and over a period of years, we avoid our avoidance.” ---------- “If our primary caregivers are shame-based, they will act shameless and pass their toxic shame onto us. There is no way to teach self-value if one does not value oneself.” “Toxic shame is multigenerational. It is passed from one generation to the next. Shame-based people find other shame-based people and get married. As each member of a couple carries the shame from his or her own family system, their marriage will be grounded in their shame-core.” “The major outcome of this will be a lack of intimacy. It’s difficult to let someone get close to you if you feel defective and flawed as a human being.” ― John Bradshaw “When I look at narcissism through the vulnerability lens, I see the shame-based fear of being ordinary. I see the fear of never feeling extraordinary enough to be noticed, to be lovable, to belong, or to cultivate a sense of purpose.” ---------- “Shame derives its power from being unspeakable.” ----------- “The biggest potential for helping us overcome shame is this: We are ‘those people.’ The truth is…we are the others.” “Most of us are one paycheck, one divorce, one drug-addicted kid, one mental health illness, one sexual assault…away from being ‘those people‘—the ones we don’t trust, the ones we pity, the ones we don’t let our kids play with, the ones bad things happen to, the ones we don’t want living next door.” ― Brené Brown “The shame-based person is nearly always enmeshed in some way with one or more people. “While we are in a dysfunctional, shame-based relationship, we may feel like we are losing our mind, going crazy. When we try to test reality, we are unable to trust our senses, our feelings and our reactions.” ― Charles L. Whitfield “I felt ashamed."" ""But of what? Psyche, they hadn't stripped you naked or anything?"" ""No, no, Maia. Ashamed of looking like a mortal -- of being a mortal."" ""But how could you help that?"" ""Don't you think the things people are most ashamed of are things they can't help?” ― C.S. Lewis “Why are you drinking? demanded the little prince. ""So that I may forget,"" replied the tippler. ""Forget what?"" inquired the little prince, who was already sorry for him. ""Forget that I am ashamed,"" the tippler confessed, hanging his head. ""Ashamed of what?"" insisted the little prince, who wanted to help him. ""Ashamed of drinking!” ― Antoine de Saint-Exupéry",henrygatz,https://old.reddit.com/r/ShameGuilt/comments/1l251b9/some_quotes_on_shame_you_may_find_helpful_fee/

ShameGuilt,Is acceptance the key to healing shame? (self.ShameGuilt),"I’m working through toxic shame that has been with me for most of my life and am searching for ways to find peace with the things I’m ashamed about. I’ve been listening to Tim Fletcher’s videos on YouTube and reading some books on the topic. I’m trying to understand how I can heal my shame so it doesn’t impact me anymore and things I can do each and every day to heal. From what I’ve seen so far it seems like sitting with my emotions, thinking about the things I feel ashamed about, and accepting them with neutrality rather than shame is key. Also developing self-esteem is important Does anyone have advice or experience from overcoming their own toxic shame?

ShameGuilt,I was a bad partner (self.ShameGuilt),"I did some very bad mistakes that still haunt me to this day. You see I was a bad partner. I would emotionally abuse my partner. When we first got into talking I had just got cheated on by my ex numores of times and I still stayed. She had to break it off with me since she was dating her ex while she was trying again with me. I was left destroyed and my self esteem went extremely low. I was very depressed those days even when we trying again or dating. Anyways fast forward this girl came up to me and started to talk to me. We ended up talking and then after that I remembered she confessed to me. I told her I wasn’t ready as I was fresh out of a toxic relationship. I was hurt. She said she was willing to help me out on my journey of healing. I told her it was a bad idea since we’re only going to hurt ourselves more. My stupid self ended up giving in. We dated for a year. I would lash out on her and say very bad things to her. In my head I felt like I had two different people. One was telling me “Why are you doing this? You’re becoming the person you didn’t want to. Stop please.” My conscious was telling me something and I wasn’t listening thinking everything would be okay someday. I started to change my ways towards the end. I started to be kinder to myself and to her. But then she told me she couldn’t continue, she was deeply drained from the relationship and that she can’t keep going. That’s when I felt a knife to my hurt and it was like someone was stabbing me repeatedly. I was distraught. After we broke up, I wasn’t able to fully accept that we weren’t together anymore. After a while I accepted it and I’m trying to move on. I sent her a goodbye text and she just told me our relationship was hell for her and that she hopes the next girl doesn’t go through the same. She has every right to feel that way. I blame myself for everything. I was so stupid and ignorant. I know I did wrong but even knowing doesn’t change the fact I hurt a sweet soul. And for what? What did I win from that? Nothing at all. Something this break up did bring was being able to find myself and finally heal properly. Give my soul the time to reflect and rest. But part of me well most of me feels so bad. I hurt her so bad. I look at the sky and think “I hope you’re doing okay, and I hope you know I’m so deeply sorry and ashamed of how wrong I did you”. We had our sweet moments in our relationship. I would let her cry on my shoulder and I would always try my best to cheer her up with cuddling or doing something together. I remember she was so insecure of her body. I would tell her how beautiful she is and that every part of her is special. I would kiss the parts that she was insecure of. I feel so guilty. I’m trying to forgive myself but it’s hard when you know you hurt someone else.",Weary_Ad_4320,https://old.reddit.com/r/ShameGuilt/comments/1eojntx/i_was_a_bad_partner/
ShameGuilt,My guilt (self.ShameGuilt),"My grandpa was a kind, inspiring, and generous figure in my life. During the time when I helped him overcome his illness before being admitted into the hospital, he noticed me getting ready to go to school for a practice interview with no belt. He asked if I didnt have one and I responded back, saying it broke a few weeks ago. Being the generous man that he is, he told me that he was going to get me one. Little did I know I wouldn't be getting just any belt, but the belt he once wore when he passed and received it when it was time to give his belongings away. What hurt the most was I failed him, yet I still received something so precious even after his death. The night before his death I experienced an excruciating amount of tooth pain and he wanted me to stay by his side. I could notice a big difference that night in the way he talks compared to the day before. It was as if he lost all his energy in that short amount of time. he talked to me about the pain each time he swallows and about him having trouble breathing, which I relayed to the nurse but they couldn't do anything aside from giving him pain killers with us brothers changing his position throughout the night to help his airways. Throughout this I kept making jokes and encouraging him that he can make it through as he did in the past. The only thing he wanted was for me to stay by his side throughout the night, but I wanted to sleep in order to ignore the toothache, and so I stood by his side for less than an hour and slept. When the sun was up, he was in an even weaker state, with a doctor on the scene preparing some sort of feeding tube for medicine as he can't swallow as much anymore, he always mentioned that he'd rather die than to have a bunch of tubes ran through his body and this scene was traumatizing for me to watch as it looked painful and he was so uncomfortable. That was the last moment I heard him talk. Some time passed and I checked up on him quite a bit, asking if he was okay, with the only way for him to communicate was through his eyebrows. This continues for a while with me periodically checking on him if he's okay but around 10am my mom arrives and notices the state he is in. I explain to her what has happened this early morning but she mentions him not even communicating, at all. I got scared. My mind was filled with the worst outcome. What if I failed to watch him, as the assigned watcher. What if I failed to give him the care he deserves. What should I have done instead of focusing on easing the pain of my tooth. I rushed over trying to see a pulse as I ask repeatedly, ""are you ok?"" He responded once again with his eyebrows Lifting them up twice Again and again I listened to his faint yet beating heart and asked again Receiving the same answer. This was when I contacted the nurse ward through the emergency switch And in a matter of seconds, the faint heartbeat was no more. Nurses appear and more assistance came, starting manual compressions I could only watch in silence, and beat myself up on how stupid I was It was not after his heart stopped that I thought clearly. What if I gave him instructions. One eyebrow raise for yes, Two for no. I could've prevented all this . I could've noticed sooner. I was the closest to his side. I failed him. It was later revealed that he suffered a stroke which was why he couldn't move any part of his body. If only I thought this could happen If only I could've been faster If only I could think better If only I wasn't scared Maybe he wouldn't have to leave this soon. When I even wanted him to see me graduate. When I wanted him to celebrate our close birthdays together most especially this year. Still, I failed him As his watcher As his grandchild As his caretaker He'd give us everything he could Yet I couldn't even watch him properly. Im overwhelmed with guilt And I dont know how to live with this.",Alone-Ad4555,https://old.reddit.com/r/ShameGuilt/comments/1d4v1g9/my_guilt/
ShameGuilt,How do I cope with my past mistakes? (self.ShameGuilt),"Hello, around 2021/22, at the age of 19, I experienced heartbreak for the first time due to a close friend who got into a relationship just before I could confess my love to her. During this time, I felt very lost and shortly after, I was extremely dissatisfied with my first subject of study in university. I felt inferior and had major attention issues, leading me to do some morally reprehensible things. I fabricated severe falsehoods about myself to gain attention, such as inventing a girlfriend, claiming a different nationality to seem more interesting, falsely alleging childhood rape with an invented perpetrator (not implicating a real person), falsely claiming the death of family members, and pretending to have cancer, all of which were untrue. During this period, I was lost and engaged in destructive behavior at parties, like damaging a friend's television and denying responsibility. I told my lies initially to the Girl and later, realizing it garnered attention, to other friends, perpetuating the lies for months. I also became jealous of the girl's boyfriend, creating fake accounts to send threatening messages to her, her boyfriend, and their family members in Turkish (as they have Turkish heritage). However, I was caught, and understandably, the boyfriend was furious, threatening me with severe violence, damaging my car, and later threatening to rape my mother. From then on, I lost credibility with the girl and our friendship dissolved. I continued to deny involvement, fabricating a new person who didn't exist, but no one believed me anymore. I also insulted this group of people, including the lies, in my music, claiming, among other things, that the girl abandoned me due to an illness. I continued to have contact with friends from that girl's circle, blaming and manipulating them within the group. I fell in love with another girl from the circle, who rejected me. Out of frustration, I repeatedly ordered pizzas to her address in her name, leading to her filing a harassment complaint against me. Although I wasn't convicted, which could have jeopardized my career prospects, and the charges were dropped under conditions, I had to donate 500€ due to insulting the police officer involved. The other girls from that circle then wanted nothing to do with me because I denied my actions. After many months, I couldn't sustain the lies anymore, feeling stressed and guilty. I went as far as creating a social media account for the imaginary girlfriend and cutting my hair short for authenticity, which led me to seek therapy with a naturopath because I found these actions disturbing and feared having a personality disorder or even a behavioral disorder like compulsive lying. I also developed derealization as a stress symptom during this time. The naturopath helped me, and I started a new degree in which I'm very successful. After some time, the naturopath suggested that these actions were likely a result of heartbreak and that people do very foolish things in such situations. However, I might have been temporarily psychotic. But since I no longer tell such lies and feel remorse, these severe illnesses wouldn't apply to me. Afterward, I apologized to many friends for my lies, and most were understanding and forgave me, and I remained friends with them.",hallo-bot7777,https://old.reddit.com/r/ShameGuilt/comments/1cdhaqg/how_do_i_cope_with_my_past_mistakes/
ShameGuilt,Feeling like I'm a social failure (self.ShameGuilt),"I had a friend group last year. They were people I really liked. But this year I wasn't in the same class as them. I struggled to keep contact with them and because I felt we were drifting apart I didn't make enough effort to make me included. I them tried to invite myself once but got lied to saying there were too much people at the party because they didn't want the friend(not from the group) who was coming with me. We continued to drift apart and when I made the decision to make efforts again i learned that a girl in the group said things about me behind my back, and didn't want to come to hang outs if I were invited. Made me drift away even more because apparently she wasn't the only gossiping( it wasn't really mean things either) I talked to her about it but she try to make me the villain saying that she thought I wanted to hit her because of a tiktok, but it was posted after I learned what she was doing lol so she was lying. She didn't think she was excluding me. At this point I almost never saw my friends at school let alone outside of school. I invite them all to my birthday but they even make the effort to respond for the gift or to know if they were coming. My friends organising my birthday had to run after them. For the last hang out she did it again. I talked to my closest friend in the group, she first told me that they thought about it but some in the group said that they wouldnt come if i came. She then told me to get over it, (not in a mean way), that it was a long time since ive been with them, a lot from the group didnt even thought to invite me and she couldnt do anything about it because i dont talk to the other anymore. (Dont really agree with that i talk with at leat 5 person of the group and i invited them to my birthday but i see why she says that.)She also told me that I was progressively excluded from the hang outs. Now I'm not part of the group and it hurt me very much. I feel like I list meaningful connections and I like that group very much. I feel like if I did more efforts back then instead of waiting to be seen and invited it would be different. But at the same time I feel like I did some efforts (my birthday for exemple) and I absolutely hate running after people. But maybe my efforts were too late. I also don't know if I'm crazy to think that the girl is really in cause of most of my drifting apart, she don't think she has anything to be sorry for, even though she participated in my exclusion and she hadn't any reason to say such things again I feel really bad I acted this way and feel like it's my fault.

ShameGuilt,Anxiety and panic over hurting someone (self.ShameGuilt),"When I was a teenager, I blackmailed someone who used to be a friend with nudes for more nudes. This is the worst thing I have ever done and I regret it every day. I never reached out to apologize or make amends, which I also regret. Now I’m in my 30s and the guilt for this is burning in me every day. No one in my life knows I did this. Every moment I spend with my wife I’m burning with guilt and shame. My discomfort is less important than the pain I caused, I know I’m not the victim here. I just don’t know how to move forward without destroying my relationships by telling my loved ones.",Neat-Stock2851,https://old.reddit.com/r/ShameGuilt/comments/1kaqrqv/anxiety_and_panic_over_hurting_someone/

ShameGuilt,Revisiting Memories. (self.ShameGuilt),"I have a lot of shame. Thinking back to my sexual experiences, I would say they were out of desperation, I never thought about how mentally draining and taxing it would be on me. The one that stands out the most in terms of shame is the experience I had with a transgender woman. I messaged her on Grindr and found out we were close. So I eventually met up with her and at the time I couldn't invite her over and she had people inside as well, so we go to this bush that also acted as a hiding spot. We did what we did and at the time I wasn't thinking. Now fast forward a few weeks and I'm walking by that exact spot when I start to think.. There was a LDS church behind the bush and to my horror, an elementary school... After I've had this realization it was then when I started feeling like a monster and feeling what I've done was despicable and it's breaking me. I don't know who I am anymore. The old me? Would have never done such things like this. I just want this pain to end, even if I have to kill myself.",Xoshooot45,https://old.reddit.com/r/ShameGuilt/comments/1k4kfea/revisiting_memories/
ShameGuilt,i killed a lizard on purpose when i was young and i still feel guilty and evil (self.ShameGuilt),"I don’t even remember it very well now. What I do know is I was probably a little under 10 years old, maybe younger than that though. 5-9 years maybe. I used to like to go out and catch the lizards that would crawl around the walls and bricks outside the house, and then I’d usually just hold them for a while, or put them in one of those little mesh-and-plastic bug catcher toys and carry them around for a bit. I don’t know why I did it—I doubt they were happy about it but most of the time I tried to be careful or at least harbored no purposeful malice toward them. So just fun to catch and hold them I guess. I have no idea what prompted this one time, all I remember is that it happened. Maybe it bit me too hard and the light pain was enough to make my child self mad and violent, maybe it went deeper and like some part of me was angry or afraid from something else and just wanted to feel powerful whatever way I could. I wish I knew why I did it. I didn’t do anything too gory thank god, but I remember trying to shake it around hard in a container, and eventually filling the container with some water I guess to drown it. I hate having to write it out, I’m so sorry little lizard. Maybe somehow you made it through and I didn’t realize. I hope you did. I do remember that even back then I felt immediate crushing guilt as soon as I was done. I remember now, breaking down crying when I realized what exactly I did and burying it under the leaves out in the yard. It was like waking up from some possession. I don’t think I ever told anybody though. I don’t know what was or is wrong with me that made me act that way. I wasn’t just carelessly “exploring” or anything like that, like kids who cut up bugs just to see what happens without thinking about the animal, I know it was on purpose. It feels so incongruent with who I am now. I major in environmental science but I’m looking to focus on animal conservation and evolution, or animal behavioral science if I’m lucky. I try to treat animals with respect and put good out into the world for them. Just today I took a bunch of cat food to the shelter as a holiday donation. I love my animal friends more than anything. I read and talk incessantly about the minds and lives of other species. Of course all this just sounds like I’m trying to reverse what I said and prove what a great person I am. I don’t know. I don’t know why I did it. That’s the kind of thing budding serial killers do so I don’t understand how some version of me ever thought to do that while still growing up into who I am now. Is it still in me somewhere? Maybe that’s the worst part is that it sort of makes no sense to me, but it doesn’t matter if it does or not, because it’s still there in the past and still haunts me.",throwaway77736362727,https://old.reddit.com/r/ShameGuilt/comments/1hjup4o/i_killed_a_lizard_on_purpose_when_i_was_young_and/
ShameGuilt,OCD and guilt (self.ShameGuilt),"I’ve always struggled with guilt and shame, since I was a kid. Recently I got diagnosed with OCD, with the obsession being ruminating through memories (sometimes false memories) and the compulsion is to “confess”. I’ve never been religious and my family was catholic, but not devoted, so idk where this comes from. All of the memories are about sex. I was hypersexual, growing up. I had little impulse control, sought to always please the boys I was with, and had no regards for my safety or others safety. I was molested when I was about 6-7, so I learned that shit. The memories that constantly make their way back are a few: - I have a vague memory of trying to play inappropriately with my brother. I think I was 9 and him 4-5. I remember the exact words he said to stop it before I did anything. I am thankful to this day, but ashamed as well. - I was around 19-20 when I went on a camping trip with my bf (same dude) and my family. They refused to let us sleep in a tent by ourselves, so they put us with my brother (15-ish) and my cousins (15-ish and 12-ish). When everyone was asleep, bf wanted a handjob. I said yes. Next to my brother and cousins. Like, they could have seen it; they could have woken up. Why the fuck did I agree? Did I initiate it maybe? I don’t remember. - I was around 18-19, my bf and i were messing around in his bedroom with closed door. His little sister came in and he did not stop. Rubbing against me. My spouse now (someone different from ex-bf) knows about all of these. They keep trying yo reassure me I am not terrible with what I feel like are excuses (“you were young” “you learned that” “we all make mistakes and move on”) but idk. I feel like I deserve all the lack of sleep, the chest pain, the nausea, the disgust. It’s the least I deserve. Sometimes I feel like the confessing part is to assuage my guilt; other times I feel I’m just coming up with excuses to not take accountability. Idk anymore. I just want to die.",TA-confessions,https://old.reddit.com/r/ShameGuilt/comments/1g3r21y/ocd_and_guilt/
ShameGuilt,So much shame (self.ShameGuilt),"I stole today from Walmart. The ""funny"" thing is, there was a warning too that I completely ignored. As I was about to check out, a random alert came up that the worker didn't know what it was so she just turned it off for me to proceed. I should've known!! (smh) As I was walking out a man tried to stop me but I didn't stop for him. I threw my bags in my front seat and drove away as fast as I could. I went to another parking lot and cried. I decided to call Walmart and talk to security to ask if I can bring the items back (it maybe was $75 worth if that) He agreed and promised he wouldn't call the police. The man did take down my information and told me if I was caught again I would be charged. I am so upset and ashamed. I can't tell anyone IRL and I don't think I can even return to that Walmart store. Why didn't I think about what I was doing! It's not like I don't have money AND I knew what that alert was saying without straight up saying it.

A few months ago, our new neighbor decided to report her to the city for having an “illegal shed” in the backyard. It was total BS, the shed’s been there for years and has full permits. An inspector came out, checked everything, and left without saying a word. But the neighbor? Smug. Proud. Thought he’d scared us. So I did a little digging. Turns out his brand-new pool was way too close to the property line and illegally built over a utility easement. I reported him. Attached photos. Quoted city codes. Two weeks later, the city ordered him to either move it (impossible) or fill it in. He lost the whole thing $40,000 down the drain. Literally. Now he gets to look at our completely legal shed every day… while standing over a pile of dirt where his pool used to be.

confession,Terminally ill and racking up credit card debt with zero fucks to give (self.confession),"I’ve had cancer for 2 years now, did chemo, lost my leg, beat odds and managed to even go back to work, well shit hit the fan and treatment stopped working. Probably got weeks, maybe couple months at best. I am 22, don’t own a house, don’t own my car. Have maybe £2k in the bank. So I took out a credit card, 6.5k limit, 0% APR for 20 months. (I was previously building up a good credit score) and am now buying whatever the fuck I want. The debt will die with me, and I give no fucks. And if you want to beef me about driving your bank fees up with this behaviour, at least you get to live. lol EDIT:: Thank you all for your amazing responses. Unfortunately it’s bone cancer that has spread through my whole body, so I’m too weak now to travel far, as much as I would have wanted to see the world. I’m going to go bigger, and do some good stuff, if you have ideas. I want to do some big donations to food banks and cancer charities that supported me through my journey and make some differences before I pop. Alsos shame on you all of you asking me for money. UPDATE 2: Took out some more cards, thanks for the suggestions Some of you asking, I’m a girl haha I’ve bought lots of things for my family, mostly sentimental things with my handwriting on. I bought a crab at a fancy ass seafood place. That was awesome I’ve donated to animal shelters and food banks. Also to the cancer charities who helped drag my ass through this. Also can y’all stop telling me to find Jesus, I respect those of you who are praying for me, because I know that’s your way of thinking of me and I’m really touched by that. But finding god is in no way in my plans and not what I believe will happen after death, trying to force religion down a dying persons throat is really not the vibe. Update 3: Still hanging on, I’ve deteriorated quite a lot now, lost a lot of functionality in my body at this point so I’m bedbound and mostly just watching lots of TV and seeing family. But I’m comfortable, eating apples and cheese and lots of little treats. Thank you all for still checking in and thinking of me. I’m really fortunate to be surrounded by my friends and family right now, when you boil it all down to it in the end, it really is all you need.

And it’s not because I didn’t want to attend that concert, I really wanted that, but not even one of my friend agreed, it’s not about the concert only, I am a person who lives alone and my family lives in a different town, I see people on their birthday getting tagged in shit ton of stories or post, but no one ever tags me, i didn’t even got a call from my family I had a friend who used to call it at exactly 12 but today I didn’t even get that call, I asked my office colleagues to celebrate my birthday with me and I will sponsor liquor’s and cakes and everything yet they said they had plan for weekends, i hope I am not a terrible person, I think I am but I always wished people on time, I never purposefully hurt anyone but if I did I am sorry, I never did that though, I think they did not like how I look maybe, I have vitiligo and I am not that successful for my age, because I am little under confident, is that why people hate me, I don’t know why people hate me cause if I am unsuccessful I can be successful but that’s not it, maybe they hate that I have vitiligo, maybe that’s the reason, but I didn’t ask for it, I just got it, but can people just hate me just because I have vitiligo, I think so, I wouldn’t hate anyone though, I love all kind of people even the one who literally beaten the shit out of me when I was school because I got offended cause they were making jokes on my skin condition, maybe I shouldn’t got offended at that time, and they were only having fun I could have ignored them or maybe laughed with them, that might have resulted in a good friendship maybe, they might have wished me, I think I was always the problem, that’s why not even my parents loves me as they love my brother, he’s successful, he’s abroad with his wife and a dog, they are amazing, they didn’t wish me though it’s okay it’s still not over his office hours he is 6 hrs behind so he might have forgotten and it’s Okay, he’s busy, but he was the only one who understood me, but then when he got married and he got busy and it’s understandable, hope he becomes more successful, even last year he forgot my birthday, because he had this big project he was working, my friend that always called me he didn’t call though, he said he was travelling, might be that, I think people forget me cause I am not that important, and that’s fine I don’t add anything but only takes, I think I am Terrible for not adding value in life of people maybe after that only people will call me on my birthday, but I think it’s too late now cause I think if I leave now, no one would be that hurt as they already created distance from me, and they won’t feel sad, i am a terrible person and maybe that’s why my ex called got married to someone else, she took a right decision who wants a person who will always be vulnerable infront of them, although I was strong when she told me that she’s getting married in 3 weeks, and her roka is day after tomorrow, I didn’t shed a single tear and didn’t uttered an emotional word, I just left saying congratulations enjoy your life, she might thought I am heartless, well I was heartbroken not heartless but I can understand her POV, I think you can understand why I am a terrible person, and isn’t it better to sleep forever not knowing what happened to you Edit: I don’t know what to write now? Just that there are literally close to 2k people that actually wanted to be my friend and wished me, I was crying last night that not even single person called or messaged and I woke up with so many wishes, my phone is heating because of all the notifications I have been getting I woke up and it’s 7:25 am exactly 7 hours when I started writing that post, and I think this could have been the best thing I can ask for!

confession,I Faked Liking Sparkling Water for 3 Years and Now I’m Trapped (self.confession),"I’m 30 now, but this started when I was around 27, during a phase where I was trying really hard to be one of those “put-together adults” who meal prep, drink sparkling water, and have plants that aren’t just dying slowly in the corner. So I bought a 12-pack of LaCroix because, you know, that’s what the cool, healthy people were drinking. First sip? It tasted like someone whispered the word “fruit” into a cup of TV static. Absolutely disgusting. But I had already posted it on my Instagram story with the caption: “New addiction lol.” And that was the beginning of my downfall. Friends started bringing LaCroix over when they visited. Coworkers stocked it in the office fridge “because I liked it.” My girlfriend (now fiancée) thought it was cute how “into sparkling water” I was, so she bought me a SodaStream for Christmas. Now I’m in too deep. I’ve become the guy who nods thoughtfully while drinking what is essentially spicy sadness. I have flavors in my fridge with names like “Pamplemousse” and “Limoncello,” and I pretend like I can tell the difference. I can’t. It all tastes like carbonated regret. Sometimes I just want a normal drink. But if I ever open a Gatorade, someone will say, “Whoa, no LaCroix today?” and I’ll just fake laugh like, “Haha, gotta switch it up!” Meanwhile my soul is quietly screaming. Anyway, if you’re young and reading this: never lie about your beverages. That stuff will haunt you.

confession,I'm putting my extremely profoundly disabled 7 year old into a residential facility so I can forget he exists. I'm not sorry.Custom (self.confession),"I can't tell anyone this, even my therapist. Lambast me if you wanr and maybe I even deserve it. I only ask what you would do if you were in my situation. Not what you think ""people should"" do. What you would REALLY do. I'm a single mom of 2 boys. 12 and 7. My husband passed away 3 years ago in a work accident. A very large portion of me believe it was a suicide. I can't see him EVER making the mistake he made that caused his death, and he had taken an action just before that which ensured his co-workers weren't in the room. I fully believe he killed himself because of our younger son and no one will ever change my mind. We were told when I was pregnant that he would have Downs Syndrome. We could handle that. Even if it was severe. It turned out he has a chromosome deletion. His disorder is kind of rare so I won't post which specific one but suffice to say he'll never be anything more than he is now or has ever been. And what he is, is nothing. He doesn't appear to have any awareness and never has. His eyes are locked in one position, he doesn't respond to noise, touch, or pain. He is total care. He is capable of nothing. He is tube fed and on oxygen. He is in diapers and will be forever. He makes no sounds, no attempts to communicate. He never even really cried as a baby. He has never made an attempt to interact with anyone or his environment. I'm not upset because I got a special needs/""imperfect"" child. I feel the way I feel because this...... thing..... takes up 200% of my time and does NOTHING. I didn't get an imperfect child. I didn't get a child. I don't love him. He doesn't have any personality, there is nothing to love. And yet I'm responsible for him. In addition to his extreme delays he's also medically fragile. Respiratory crises, fecal impactions (his autonomic nervous system doesn't function properly), issues with his G tube, infections, pressure sores no matter WHAT we put him on or how we position him. Our older son has suffered because his non existent brother has colored everything in his life. He's had medical care get delayed because there's only one of me and hos brother is more critical. We do have a visiting home nurse but only 20 hrs/week and we aren't eligible for more. I was starting law school, I gave up my dreams and my plan for my children for this potato. My older son can't do a lot of things he wants to do because of the youngers need for care and appointments. The final straw was I heard a sound. I went into Younger Son's room to check, thinking he had forgotten how to breathe again, and saw Older Son hitting him and screaming ""You're why I don't have a mother! You're why I don't have a father! You're why I can't have friends over! You're why I can't be in sports! I didn't ask for you and I hope you die!"" Instead of being horrified, I watched. And Younger Son just did. not. react. No signs of pain or fear or upset. No reaction at all. He breathes but he is not alive. He doesn't know who I am. He doesn't know who Older Son is. He has no sense of self, life experience, or awareness of his surroundings. He doesn't need to be in my home. He doesn't know or care where he is. He is genetically my son but he is not family. My previously abused, brain damaged cat who can't walk straight has more personality and is far more loveable than my ""child"". In fact I was looking FORWARD to raising a Downs baby. Even one with severe impairments, for that reason. With disability can come gifts. This boy is not a gift. He is a genetic mistake I probably should have miscarried and would have definitely terminated if I'd known he would be like this. And the flip side is, if he HAS awareness..... he's miserable. And there is nothing I can do. If he has likes and dislikes no one knows what they are. If he is in pain he can't tell anyone. If he wants anything, he can't communicate. He's had every imaginable therapy, nothing has made a difference. And so he's leaving our home on the 29th. I feel excited and relieved and then guilty because I know we'll be happier with him gone. He's already taken my husband and my son's father. He was working so so so much OT to pay for the cucumber's care. For the experimental therapies insurance wouldn't cover. Because THIS one was going to be the BREAKTHROUGH. He was tired and defeated and disappointed. He sought counseling as well but I don't think he could ever say the words ""I don't want my son in my home"" either. He's ruined my older son. I was so wrapped up on the younger I never realized how ignored and damaged he was. He lost his father too. I didn't just lose my husband. HE is my priority now and this malignant lump can be someone else's problem. At least they'll be paid a wage to care for him. At least they'll get a break from him when they punch out. I just want to never think of him again and I'm not sorry. And for that, I'm sorry. Thanks for reading. Edit: Thanks /u/piconeeks, for calling me a liar. Are you a medical doctor? If your Google Fu was any good you would have stumbled on 3p mosaic deletion-duplication syndrome. That is the disorder my son has. I've basically identified myself by posting that but hey, it's better than the PMs telling me to kill myself. If you look at the features of 3p deletion syndromes they look like Downs. My insurance didn't cover AFP testing which would have told us it WASN'T Downs and I didn't think we needed it. I had a regular ultrasound and a 3D. Both Drs were ""99% sure it was Downs"". This post was absolutely NOT fiction. Instead the mods and especially /u/piconeeks just ""decided"" it was. If anyone would like I'll doxx myself. You can see my ID to verify my name, my marriage license, and my husband's death certificate. I will then link you to the news article of the ""freak industrial accident"" that ended his life so you can see it's the same person. As for not choosing hospice for my son - I can't. About a year ago I myself was hospitalized with severe depression and C-PTSD (there is proof of that too). During that time my late husbands mother petitioned to get control as my son's medical proxy and got it. I'm fighting it but it's a long, complicated process. There are competency hearings. There are statements from doctors and evaluations. Unless SHE oks hospice, which she refuses, I cannot decide that. I have custody. I cannot ake medical decisions. She agreed to residential care which I feel is the second best option. So, he's going into residential care. As for ""mistaking"" a child choking with hitting, I was downstairs. I couldn't hear what my older son was saying. I only knew he was speaking. Go punch a blanket or, idk, a person with weak muscle tone. Then ask said person with weak muscle done to cough. They don't cough normally/forcefully. It's more a ""strong puff"". Similar to, again.... idk... a muted punch. When you're used to jumping at every strange sound, it's difficult to discern what's what sometimes. So, /u/piconeeks..... anything else you'd like to know? Care to admit I just might be telling the truth? There were identify details I left out but guess y'all need them.",SpecialNeedsDevil,https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/c11din/im_putting_my_extremely_profoundly_disabled_7/
confession,I gaslit my college library out of late fees by returning my own books (self.confession),"Back in college (00's) one semester I took out several books for a big research project. This was back when internet research was not admissible, and you needed to properly cite all your sources. School & life got away from me, and I forgot about them for a while. That was until the end of the semester when I got a late library dues bill in the mail. I think the fees were 25 cents per book per day - if not more - and I had at least 10 books over a month late! I didn't have any money, and if you had outstanding library dues, you could not get your grades/transcript for the semester. Instead of sheepishly returning the books and paying the fines, I put the books in my backpack, smuggled them into the library, and returned them all to their correct places on the shelves. I then called the library the next day and questioned the validity of the letter regarding my overdue books. The librarian left me on hold for a few minutes and returned to the phone apologizing to me that it seemed the books had in fact been returned!

confession,"When I was a kid, I drugged my dad for a whole month (self.confession)","Warning: contains abuse. My father was a raging asshole. He used to beat us and yell at us about how worthless we were constantly. My mother finally had enough, and said that either he gets psychological help, or she leaves him. He went to the doctor, and was prescribed an antipsychotic medication. When he started taking it, he magically became nice! No more beatings, no more yelling... it was paradise. Then, after a while, he turned mean again. We asked our Mom what was going on, and she said that he stopped taking his medication because he didn't like the side effects, whatever that meant. We felt doomed. Until one day, my mom accidentally? left his prescription bottle in the kitchen. My sister and I looked at each other and didn't even have to say a thing. She got out a spoon and I ground the white pill into powder, and we put it in his orange juice. What a nice day we had!

confession,marrying for money sucks and I do not recommend it (self.confession),"Married a 40 year old when I was 19. Started dating when I was 17. Yes, it was gross but that's what happened. The only reason he married me is because I was hot. The only reason I married him is because he had money. I actually do have other redeeming characteristics but he married me because I was hot. I know this. Everyone knows this. It doesn't feel great but I can deal with it. We've been married 20 years. 4 kids. So we are stable and we have lots in common at this point. And we do love each other. But if I could go back and slap myself I would. What nobody tells you- or they try and you don't listen because you're a dumbass teenager- is that marrying like this means you will fucking owe him. For everything. Every goddamn day. Not just in the bedroom but in every other matter in your life. The stuff you never imagined someone else trying to decide for you. And you don't just owe him for the money. It's a lot heavier than that. He'll never say it out loud. But you'll know the deal. Fundamentally unequal. He'll pull rank at the most random times and it will make you feel like you're falling through the floor. I don't hate my life or anything. I accept that I made this bed and I have to lie in it but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone else.

confession,"I’ve been faking an allergy for YEARS, and now it’s gone way too far. (self.confession)","This started as a dumb excuse, and now I’m in too deep. Years ago, I went on a date with this girl who was obsessed with peanut butter. She kept pushing me to try her peanut butter smoothie, even after I said I wasn’t in the mood. Instead of just saying no, I blurted out, ""Oh, I can’t—I’m allergic."" Big mistake. She was super concerned, asked a million questions, and I figured, whatever, I’d never see her again. But then she introduced me to her friend group. And they all knew about my ""allergy."" At that point, correcting it felt too awkward. Fast forward six years. I’m still friends with these people. My “allergy” is a known fact. They warn restaurants for me, they check ingredients, one of them even threw out a peanut butter cake someone brought to a party ""just to be safe."" The worst part? I love peanut butter. I eat it in secret. I have a stash at work. Once, my best friend said, ""Man, it must suck not knowing what a Reese’s tastes like."" And I just nodded solemnly. Now, my girlfriend (who also believes I’m allergic) wants us to move in together… and she’s super cautious about food. I’m terrified she’ll find my peanut butter stash and think I’ve been LYING TO HER. Which I have. For years. I have no idea how to get out of this. Do I fake a ""miracle recovery""? A medical misdiagnosis? Or do I just keep the lie going forever?

confession,Cop pulled me over and I called 911 and lied to get out of going to jail. (self.confession),"When I was 19 I was running late to work in my tiny POS economy car and on fumes of gas I didn’t come to a complete stop on a right turn. Lights behind me so I pull over. I know I’ve barely got any gas at all and was almost to a gas station, hence why I rolled through the stop a little. Trying not to have the car die. At the time (around 1995) a new digital phone had come out called Voicesteam (now TMoblie) and their whole big thing was the phones were digital and not cellular. They were the first phones with caller ID and one of the big things the salesman had said over and over was since it was digital the signal couldn’t be triangulated or traced. Not that I cared but it stuck in my mind. Well as I give the cop my license, registration and insurance card I got an idea. I knew if I was late to work I was going to lose my job. They were super strict there. So I get an idea and right after I hand the papers to the cop and he’s walking back to his cruiser I called 911 and tell the operator I just saw a guy with what looked like a shot gun walk into a 7-11 that was about 2 blocks away. I confirmed the address then I hung up. About 30 seconds later the cops comes sprinting to my car and hands me all my stuff and rushed says, “come to a complete stop next time!!” Then peels off to the direction of the store. Pushed my car to the gas station that I’d almost made it to and felt pretty pleased with my ingenuity. I was an idiot and I confess! Edit: Wow, this blew up. I forgot to mention I would have gotten arrested, booked and released, because I was driving with a suspended license for unpaid traffic tickets and I had a bench warrant for it. Because I’m an idiot! So it wouldn’t have been just a few mins late to work. The job was a physical high turn over one that didn’t tolerate much.

When they ask me to explain my code, I launch into a confident-sounding jargon-filled monologue, hoping they'll get lost in the technical mumbo-jumbo. The best part? I got a promotion and a raise, which basically translates to ""we're paying you more to keep pretending you're good at this.""

confession,I used to bully my disabled brother for yearsRemorse (self.confession),"UPDATE: A lot of people were asking for an update so here it is. I wrote up a long ass apology letter that I wanted to read to my brother. I waited until he got home and got into bed for the night. I knocked on his door and he was so fucking excited that it was me. I couldn't even get through the first few words. I started crying after saying ""I wanted to say I'm really sorry"" and just couldn't get through it. I just got into bed with him and laid down next to him. He hugged me really tight and said ""I missed you buddy"". I fucking lost it. I never cried that bad before. He just hugged me for a long time until I calmed down. We didn't talk much. He started crying for a bit too. It was the first time in a long time we just hugged. After half an hour I got up and gave him a kiss and he told me he was so happy. Why didn't I do this earlier, fuck. I thought I could I try apologizing properly again tomorrow. I left him the note to read anyway. I am feeling very hopeful right now and a lot of pressure in my heart is gone. I swear to God and on my own life I will never treat my brother so badly again. I have been working part-time for the past year and I was saving some money so my brother and my mom could go on a trip to a place he really wanted to go to. But I think I will take my brother myself instead (when I turn 18). I also realized that I need to have a relationship with my brother where I am not just taking care of him. It needs to be like a normal brother relationship. Like going for movies and stuff. It's going to take some time for me to fix the mess I created though. I'm just lucky my brother is amazing. I received a lot of messages. I appreciate everyone for their input and I did read them all even if I didn't reply. Thanks everyone. My actual post: [Remorse] I know this will get a lot of hate and yes I deserve it. I am not looking for any validation or forgiveness. I know I am a piece of human trash. I just need to get this out. I have a brother who is two years older then me. He has suffered from a condition since birth that forces him to be in a wheelchair anytime he is out of bed. He cannot use his arms that well either. We used to have a great relationship until I turned 11 and I really started resenting the amount of attention he took from my parents. And how much stress he put them under. I had to constantly help him, change him, feed him. I hated it. There was a few years in his life when he so mean to my parents and it really made me resent him more. I realize now that I had no right to judge him and I will never know how difficult life is for him. I stopped hanging out with him and made more friends at school. I would tell my family all the fun I was having at school during dinner to make him feel bad. I started barely talking to him or acknowledge his presence. He would get frustrated to the point of tears to get my attention. It started escalating two years ago when I would purposely turn off the wifi and unplug the tv every time we had to leave the house so my brother could do nothing but sit in his wheelchair. I would purposely delete his favorite saved shows on the DVR. I would make fun of his speech. Push things just out of his reach. I would act disgusted when I had to change or bathe him. It always made him feel bad and he would apologize. I made my own brother apologize for taking a dump. What the fuck is wrong with me? But my fucking saint of a brother never told my parents. And he never let me have it. Three weeks ago, he was trying to talk to me non-stop and I was just ignoring him. I got annoyed and wheeled him against his wishes to the backyard and placed him under an umbrella and went back inside. I fell asleep and realized I left him out there for three hours. When I went to bring him back inside he was in tears and wouldn't look at me. He was humiliated. I have always felt guilty about how I treated my brother all these years but my anger towards him overpowered it. But seeing that look on his face affected me in a way that was different from before. I stopped all the bullying after that day. I couldn't even look him in the face I was so ashamed. Last Sunday my brother told me he was glad I was his brother and friend. I couldn't even respond. I went to my room and cried. I'm fucking crying again typing this all out. When did I become an evil trash human being? Fuck. I'm 17 and he's 19 now. I know there is nothing I can do to make up for the past 6 years. My brother will be returning with my mom from a specialist appointment tonight. I'm going to apologize to him and beg for his forgiveness tonight. I want to start being being a fucking decent brother to him again. I am a healthy guy with no issues who chose to bully his only brother for something that wasn't even his fault. I am so ashamed of myself.",Krineze,https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/a1jccq/i_used_to_bully_my_disabled_brother_for_years/

Then I back my car into the spot, put it into neutral, and push it gently until it rests against the wall. So the wall completely blocks my rear plate. And I have no front plate. So the parking attendant, if they happen to walk all the way into that corner, cannot easily read my plate. I see many of my coworkers complaining about the prices, or showing parking tickets they got because they forgot to pay that day. But so far I have not gotten a ticket.

confession,"I stole over $20,000 in a very creative way in the 90'sNo Regrets (self.confession)","I worked at a fast food chain in the 90's when I was in high school. When I worked there they were in the process of phasing out denominational gift certificates. ($5, $10 & $25) The way is worked was if you spent more than half of the certificate they gave you the cash back. So if you ordered $5.50 worth of food and gave them one of the $10 gift cards, they gave you the $4.50 back in cash. My manager was in charge of destroying all the existing certificates as we transitioned to the more traditional credit card looking gift cards. So my manager said he shredded the certificates like he was supposed to, but one night when I was closing I found two boxes of the gift cards tucked deep in the dry storage room. They were FILLED with the certificates that were supposed to be shredded. So, I scooped them up, brought them out to the dumpster in trash bags and threw them away. After we closed, I came back and recovered the back, and brought the certificates home. I counted them. There were 1,000 $25, 1,000 $10, and 500 $5 certificates. None of them had expiration dates. Total haul was $40K in fast food certificates. My manager never said a word, he couldn't. He had reported them destroyed weeks earlier. Over the next three years my girlfriend and I toured every location in our state, and the next 4 states ordering food, and getting the change. We never kept track on a spreadsheet or anything, but we got good at knowing what menu items were just about half. After the first year, we started saving the change in a shoe box, and let it build up. I bought my first car for $7,800 cash from the change. And for some reason A kiddie cone was $1.05, if you gave them a $5 cert they gave you $3.95 back. We threw away a lot of kiddie cones. Edit: Holy crap this blew up. Here are the answers to some of the FAQs We could hit 10-12 stores in a day if we drove around for 5-6 hours. Both of us would use a gift cert. it was not that labor intensive. The only cameras in the store were at the cash registers & take out window. The manager has no clue who took them, or at least never treated my differently. Each gift certificate had a generic PLU on them. E.i. All the $25 were PLU #756. When we stopped selling the certificates we were told to keep honoring them because they were pre paid. They were not coupons. One can only eat so many ice cream cones.",AlBundy758,https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/8j8dho/i_stole_over_20000_in_a_very_creative_way_in_the/
confession,Our elf on the shelf is dead forever and I am so relieved (self.confession),"Last year my son (then 9) decided elf on the shelf was not real when he had a friend over.

confession,I killed an elderly man in front of his wife and basically his entire family. (self.confession),"Forgive me for any misspellings or format I’m trying to do this on my phone. I haven’t talked about this to anyone (even though it’s been years) even my closest of friends, minus the ones that were there. One nite when I was in college I was driving to get some liquor for a party my fraternity was supposed to throw the following night. I was taking a street I was very familiar with to get back to my house. It was dark but the street was lit with street lamps. I remember that I looked at my radio for a second, just a second not very long at all. But when I looked back up to the road there was a man crossing. I didn’t have any time to react, by the time I saw him he had already hit the good of my car and bounced off the side. I remember screaming and hitting the brakes, and the wash of horror of what had just happened. I’ll admit I had thought about speeding away, but I pulled over to the side and ran out of my car to check on this guy. When I got to him his family was standing outside the restaurant he was leaving and they were all screaming and crying. He has laying on the side of the road with blood coming out his nose and mouth. Two other men were standing with him trying to see if he was alright and calling 911. All I could say was “I didn’t see him” I was frantic by the time it had set in what I had done. I sat on the curb across from the family and listened to their crying in agony while we waited for the paramedics to arrive. I sat there and sobbed while to paramedics took him away in an ambulance. I don’t believe I’ve ever cried so hard and for so long. The worst part about all of it and what still kills me today was that his wife came over to me while I was distraught on that curb, sat next to me, placed her hand on my shoulder and said “I was married to him for almost 50 years. We had a good life.” Then she hugged me and said that she forgave me. After everything was said and done it was ruled that it was an accident. I wasn’t charged with anything and I had one of my friends pick me up from the police station. I went down a dark path the years after that. I drank heavily, dropped out of college in my senior year, and had to move back in with my mother and father because I couldn’t hold on to a job. Even tried to kill myself with pills. It was a hard road to recovery (witch I feel I’m not fully recovered from nor do I feel I ever will be the same). But eventually I got my life back in order. Joined up with the Navy and saw a bit of the world, and now I’m on track to go back to college and hopefully finish what I started there. It took almost a decade but I finally start to feel almost whole again. I’m back to hanging with my friends, and actually going out. So maybe there is a light at the end of the tunnel.

confession,I’m a nurse and I 100 percent judge people based on their veins (self.confession),"Okay, so I know this might sound weird, but I have to confess something. I am a nurse, and I definitely judge patients based on their veins. If you have big, straight, beautiful veins, I instantly love you. You are the MVP. I could get blood or start an IV with my eyes closed. But if your veins are tiny, hard to find, or moving around like they are trying to escape, I am already mentally preparing for a struggle. I always stay calm and professional on the outside, but inside, I am either celebrating or quietly panicking.

confession,"I slept with my daughters ex boyfriend, he got me pregnant and I had an abortion. They got back together and got married.Remorse (self.confession)","This was back in... let me think, maybe 1997? I was 38 and my daughter was 18, and she was dating Harry, who was 24. I was an alcoholic and dabbled in other drugs, mostly cocaine. I was not a good person, let alone mother. Not like I was abusive to my daughter or anything but I was generally inattentive and cared more about my alcohol and drugs than her, especially in her teen years. I am 14 years sober now. I disproved of my daughter dating harry, but I never told her why. He would flirt with me, constantly, and the age difference also creeped me out. Also, he was an alcoholic and drug user, just like me. She broke up with him over his alcoholism. Soon after she moved away, not too far but regardless she didn't live with me anymore. Harry kept calling me and asking if we wanted to get drinks, I turned him down, but then one day he said he had a bunch of coke and I couldn't resist. He came over, we did the coke, and we ended up having sex. He was a very good looking guy. He looked A LOT like that ridiculous 80s justin beiber picture that was on the front page today, that is actually what made me think about him. For the next few months, maybe like 3-4 months, he would sometimes come over and we would have sex and do drugs and get drunk together. Any drug addict knows what that is like to have a drug addict buddy in that way. Then I got pregnant. I knew it was by him, I had sex without a condom a few times stupidly. I never told him I was pregnant, and I went and got the abortion and kept it a secret. Anyways, I stopped seeing him after that, it was too weird. I also got sober, for like 4 months, before relapsing. Fast forward 2 years and my daughter contacts me and tells me that she got back with Harry, and that he is fully sober. I was mortified honestly. He was gonna tell her that we slept together, and she is going to hate me for life. They came over one day and said hi, and when my daughter was gone, Harry told me that there is no reason to tell her about what happened. I agreed. Its been 16 years of marriage on their part. They have a kid together. Harry got cancer, then beat it. I got sober. That's basically it. I don't see them very often, they live in texas and I live on the east coast. But whenever I do there is always that tension between me and Harry, its literally the first thing that comes to either of our minds, I can just tell. Not like sexual tension, like ""why did we have to do that? What the fuck is wrong with us?"" kind of tension. I think about this often. Especially when I see my grandson. I always think that could have been my son if things had gone differently, but WOW what a disaster that would have been if I decided to keep that child.",kasamaherm55,https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/9hpsab/i_slept_with_my_daughters_ex_boyfriend_he_got_me/
confession,Found out my dead best friend was in love with my wifeLight (self.confession),"[Light] I'm writing this as a confession because I don't know where else to speak about this and I don't want my kids finding this out on my main account. My friend died a few months back due to heart problems. He was taking care of himself so it was a shock to everyone. Especially his wife who was with him at their house when he died. Due to this she decided to move somewhere else and because she and her daughter were still distraught she asked me to pack up his stuff. He had some boxes in his basement and after a while I started feeling nostalgic and decided to look into them. I found pictures of us from when we were kids all the way to before we got married. That was enough to make me feel bad and I just got back to taping them up. But one of the boxes seemed to be in much better condition, so I decided to check it in case it was something important. To my surprise I found out pictures of him and my wife from when we used to hang out together, as well as more recent pictures from family reunions. The most recent being from my wife's birthday party. Alongside the pictures there were letters that he never sent her. The first one dated 2 months before I met her. The last one was also the same date of her birthday party. There was one that stood out the most was one from after I started dating her. He wrote that his time had passed and since my happiness was as important as his own he would watch over us. I'll keep his box safe since it isn't my secret to reveal.",mysxcv,https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/7l2a34/found_out_my_dead_best_friend_was_in_love_with_my/
confession,I used to reprice steaks at my work when I was younger (self.confession),"When I was 18 I worked at a piggly wiggly grocery store. After the meat department guys went home at like 3pm it was part of my job to restock meat on the sales floor throughout the night. At the time my mom worked nights and my step dad would always be passed out drunk when I got home so there would never be dinner for my brother and me. I'd always bring him home whatever he wanted (usually junk food like hot pockets, chips, etc) and I went through a huge steak phase, my family was kind of poor so we almost never got steak, it felt fancy to me. So I would go find the thickest steak we had in the cooler and change the sticker price so instead of being like $11.99lb it was $1.99lb making it exponentially cheaper.

confession,My weight loss wake up call was seeing how ugly my sister is (self.confession),"I'm overweight, as you can garner from the title. I've been trying to lose weight for years now, and while I have had some results, I am still technically clinically obese, though not morbidly. My sister is also obese, but is closer to morbidly obese than I am. Yesterday, I went on Instagram and her profile popped up, so I decided to scroll through it since I haven't seen her in almost 5 years and don't really look at my family members' social media. As I was scrolling, I came across one of her selfies and was hit with the realization that her face is my face. I had never realized just how similar we looked, but her selfie was the same face I see in the mirror everyday, and I'm horrified. I know it sounds awful, but my sister has always been the ugliest of the kids in my family, so realizing I look at all like her is not particularly pleasant. I realized that one of the reasons we look so similar was because of our face shape, very round and pudgy. Seeing her and realizing how ugly I think she is and realizing how similar we look has given me extreme motivation to lose the weight and keep it off. I can't do anything about our facial features without surgery, but hopefully by losing weight I will be able to think that we look different and won't feel so awful about my appearance. Anyway, I know that I'm an awful sister for saying so bluntly that I think my sister is actively ugly, but it's true. And it's not just her face, she also doesn't take care of herself, has hair that's been overdyed and is stringy and gross now, and recently got several face piercings (you can have your own opinion, but I think they're ugly 99% of the time). I'm probably going to see her in just over a year, so I really need to lose the weight by then for fear that anyone will comment on how similar we look.",Alone_Accident_1467,https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1jum9yq/my_weight_loss_wake_up_call_was_seeing_how_ugly/

confession,"I Let a Stranger Hide in My Apartment, and I Don’t Know If I Regret It (self.confession)","This happened last year, and I still don’t know if I made the right call. It was around 11 PM, and I had just gotten home from a late shift. I live in a small apartment in a not-so-great part of the city, so I’m always a little on edge when walking home. That night felt… off. As I was unlocking my door, I noticed a guy standing at the end of the hallway. He wasn’t doing anything, just standing there, but something about him made my stomach drop. I got inside, locked the door, and tried to shake it off. Not even five minutes later, someone knocked. Hard. I froze. It wasn’t my neighbor (she texts before coming over), and I don’t really have friends who drop by unannounced. Then, a voice - “Please, can you just let me in for a second?” It was a woman. She sounded out of breath, almost panicked. I looked through the peephole, and there she was, maybe mid 20ish, wide eyes, glancing down the hall like she was being followed. I know, I know, stupid move, but I cracked the door open just a little and asked her what is going on. She whispered that there’s a guy, he’s been following her since she left the train. She didn’t know where else to go from there. That’s when I realized. The guy I saw earlier... My heart was racing, but I stepped aside and let her in. I locked the door immediately, turned off the lights, and we just stood there in the dark, listening. A few seconds later, heavy footsteps passed my door. Slow. Like someone was looking for something. Then… nothing. She stayed for about thirty minutes, just sitting on my couch, shaking. I offered her water, and we barely talked. Eventually, she called a friend to come pick her up. When she left, she just said thank you and disappeared down the hall. I never saw her again. I don’t know if she was telling the truth. Maybe she was genuinely in danger. But I think about that night all the time, and I can’t decide if I did the right thing… or if I got really, really lucky.",404-NotFoundIRL,https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1iundet/i_let_a_stranger_hide_in_my_apartment_and_i_dont/
confession,I tell work I'm bringing my lunch allowance home because I don't have time... but I do (self.confession),"I 24(f) noticed sometime last year that my wife, also 24(f) wasn't packing proper lunches. She was taking one slice of chicken and putting it between a tiny slice of bread that would have been lucky to have butter or mayo in it. It's not her fault, I don't pack a lunch so buying all the ingredients for sandwiches that may just be thrown out because they wouldn't be used in time felt pointless. Especially because we don't have the money to be doing that. So in work I get a lunch allowance of whatever I want, but I just say I'm not hungry or don't have time to eat it and wrap up some nice sandwich or wrap so my wife can have it for her lunch. She gets so excited and happy, she texts me every single day thanking me for the lunch gave her and tells me how delicious it is. I find it fun too cause it's like a little present for my wife. And its not like i was gonna eat it anyway. When I have time I like to get creative. I'm a chef so I'm able to pick on different food throughout the day, but I graze throughout the day because I want my wife to thrive. Today she has a wrap that has mixed leaves, mozzarella, grated carrot and red cabbage, chicken tenders, crispy bacon, onion and Caribbean sauce. This is a regular enough lunch for her because it's her favourite one. Even though I already know, I can't wait for her text to tell me what she thinks, that woman makes my heart so warm.

confession,Neighbor Tried to Sabotage Our Fence. Now He Has No Yard Access. (self.confession),"I live with my mom in a quiet neighborhood. She’s the kind of person who waves at everyone and bakes cookies for new neighbors. Harmless, really. A few months ago, a guy who just moved in next door decided our side fence “violated property codes.” It didn’t. It was already there when we bought the house and had been approved by the city years ago. Still, he filed a complaint. The inspector showed up, checked the paperwork, and confirmed the fence was 100% legal. No action needed. Neighbor was annoyed. He wanted it down to expand his yard access. So I looked into his property. Turns out, the gate he installed on the other side of his yard (which he used to access the alley) cut directly through public utility space and worse, he’d paved part of it. I sent a detailed complaint to the city, with photos and documentation. No drama, just facts. A month later, the city not only ordered him to remove the gate, but also fined him for unauthorized pavement over public land. He now has to access his backyard through the front of his house, walking all the way around. And our fence? Still standing. Perfectly legal. Mom even planted flowers along it.

If someone actually tries to do anything all I’m supposed to do is lock myself in the security office and call 911.

The audit takes 30 minutes to an hour so for the other seven hours, I just smoke weed and watch movies. I know for a fact my boss doesn’t care because he told me he was high on my second day of training.

I say sure and she confesses that she had a years-long affair that ended about 2 years ago. I smile and say that's not uncommon and not so bad. She then gets very serious and says that's not the bad part. He recently died of cancer and she so wanted to see him before he died but she couldn't (her husband actually knew about the affair, but his wife never did). She was on the verge of tears saying she couldn't even go to the funeral, but she did go to his grave afterwards. She couldn't talk to her husband about it, she couldn't talk to anyone. I wanted to ask her more questions, but she stopped me. She got herself together and left to join her husband. Before the evening ended she talked to me again, with other people around. Big smile on her face saying what a great fun conversation we had. She asked to exchange numbers, which we did. She started texting me 2 days later, giving me a bit more details about the affair, explaining that she really loved the guy and missed him terribly.

confession,I held on too long and all it did was hurt my daughter (self.confession),"My daughter had multiple congenital birth defects that led to a lifetime of complications. With medically complex kids you fix one problem and create two more. She lived 11 years. It was probably 9 years too long. She lived most of her life in hospitals. Literally months at a time. She would sometimes be home a week or two and then end up back in. I don't think she ever spent more than two consecutive months out of the hospital in her entire life, until she went on palliative care. She was more comfortable in the hospital than anywhere else. How sad is that. She was the ""warrior"" kid. That was her whole identity. Making cards for her nurses and decorating her medical equipment and being Tough with a capital T. That was all she had. Never went to school, not in any meaningful capacity. Never played a sport or an instrument. Never had any real friends to speak of. Never had the health to take up any real hobbies. Just an entire life made up of surgeries, shots and nurses and fucking medical equipment to decorate. I gave her a pathetic life. There wasn't a single intervention I wasn't willing to put her through to buy more time. She was the happiest, most accepting kid I've ever met but in the last six months she was done. I refused to listen. She asked me over and over again if she could just ""stop"". I would push until she shut up and went along with what I wanted. Why did I do that. She wanted to make me happy but she knew she was done. Selfish. She died incredibly agitated and upset. I think she was scared to let go because she knew what it was going to do to me.

confession,I take a very long lunch break in the middle of my workday. (self.confession),"This has been going on for 3 1/2 years now. I work remotely at a very large fortune 50 company, Monday through Friday, for 40 hours a week. At least those are the hours that I’m “on.“ Starting around noon every workday, I take a one and a half to two hour lunch break. I purposely block off my calendar with “busy work“ so no one questions what I’ve been doing. I honestly cannot find enough hours in the week to be able to do half of the stuff that I need to be able to get done, because that’s just part of my job. There is a ton of project management and follow up with various clients. But that’s just about everyone on my team. For some reason, my boss has never questioned me or been suspicious of anything. My intuition tells me that he might do the same thing himself on his remote days, although he has a hybrid schedule. And that’s not all. I have taken vacations before during lighter project weeks, where a lot of communication isnt required between me and my team. I took my laptop and logged on during mandatory meetings and then logged off right afterwards. I know there is a lot of talk out there by corporate CEOs saying return to the office is mandatory because of stuff like this, but I always hit my goals, I do everything that’s asked of me, and I exceed expectations every year during my performance review. Honestly, this is the first time in my career where I feel like I have a “normal“ work/life balance. I feel like this is what work really should be. 30-32 hours of core work, while enjoying life the way it should be enjoyed.

confession,My Aunt hit my mother so I dragged her across the floor and punched her till she passed outConflicted (self.confession),"My Aunt is a poisonous woman. Our whole family doesn’t talk to her. She’s done things in the past you wouldn’t believe. So she left our lives years ago. Recently she returned out of the blue at my moms house. My mom has 2 other sisters and a brother. My mom and aunt never got on. My mom is a lovely person but she could sense from a young age something was off about her sister, so she kept her distance. My Aunt was nasty and would hurt people’s feeling intentionally for no reason. She never had a partner or kids. She isolated herself from everyone. My Gran cut her off when she tried to steal thousands of dollars from her. We all genuinely think there’s something physiologically wrong with her. So back to where I was going with this....one morning I was at my moms house. Just chilling out and there was a knock at the door. So I opened it and there she was. She walked in, she looked like she had took drugs. She looked dead behind the eyes. I tried to stop her but she pushed me down. I honestly don’t know why she came to my moms house out of everyone. I quickly got up and she went into the kitchen she startled my mom and punched her in the face, my mom didn’t even have a chance to blink before she hit her. She went down like a ton of bricks. My heart felt like it had been sucked through into my stomach when I seen it. Something came over me, I don’t know if it was anger or adrenaline, but I ran up behind her and grabbed her hair and I dragged her out onto the back lawn and I bashed her face about 15 times, blood was everywhere. Thankfully no one seen me or I might not of been writing this right now. I got up and I left her there. I went to check my mom, she was in a lot of pain. I looked back out the window and she was gone. We told our family immediately about this and they were perplexed and angry as to why she just turned up and attacked my mom. I’m still so hurt and angry as I write this. But I also feel tremendously guilty and upset that I done that to her because I’ve never fought anyone and I’m not a fighter at all, but something came over me and I snapped. I can’t get over it for some reason. It just seemed so unreal and there was no reason for the attack. God forbid she had a weapon that’s truly scary to think about. We didn’t call the police. As I assaulted her badly and didn’t want it to bounce back on me. That’s another thing I feel ashamed about. But should I feel bad or not? I need others opinions as I’ve been bottling this up for a while.

The offer was really meant for people sitting in the store but I would buy coffee in the morning and then bring my cup back around 1 or 2p for another cup. Apparently in NYC, they weren’t allowed to actually refill the cup for health code reasons or something. So they’d throw out the cup and give you a new one. That’s when I realized there was a loophole here. I kept five cups and brought them home. Then I started bringing one in the morning to Starbucks and I’d get a free “refill”. I’d do this every day and I’d end up with 5 gross paper Starbucks cups at work and then I’d bring them home on Friday and repeat the next week. I did this for months, not paying for coffee at all, until one day I brought in my cup and handed it to the barista for a refill only to realize that all of the cups behind the counter were different. It was getting close to the holidays and they’d switched to their holiday logo cups. Well, color me embarrassed. I started paying for coffee again after that. It was a good run though.",mtgistonsoffun,https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1kei8hh/i_got_free_coffee_from_starbucks_for_about_6/
confession,I poured skunk tincture all along my neighbors windows so they’d be quieter. (self.confession),"They were so loud all the time. I tried talking to them, telling them my boyfriend and I work at a coffee shop and bakery and our hours were really early. I bribed them with treats I made. They were constantly opening their windows and playing their music so loud for hours at all hours. Even their conversations were loud. With their windows open, even with mine closed I would know when their mom was visiting, when their boyfriends weren’t texting them back, or when they got their nails done. I did everything to cover it up. Music of my own, fans for white noise, tv, etc. it’s like they knew when I was actively trying and stepped up their game to be louder. Eventually we tried talking to landlords, made noise complaints, everything. They just learned how to be sneaky about being loud. Eventually it got spiteful. Putting music in the window, screaming and banging on the walls. Our houses weren’t connected but there was maybe a max of 10ft in between with a sidewalk going through. I was getting really stressed out. Losing sleep, couldn’t relax in my house, was getting sent home from work because I was so tired. It got really bad and I had no idea what to do. Nothing we had done up to this point had worked. When I’d explain my situation people would come up with funny revenge ideas. None of them stuck like the skunk tincture did to me. I could feel it in my bones it would work. So I ordered some on amazon and one morning as I left for work I dumped it all along the side of their house that they keep the windows open on. It smelled so bad I was worried I was gonna get some on me and I’d smell bad at work. I didn’t. Fast forward a couple hours and I get a notification on our camera that there’s motion. It faced in between the two houses along the sidewalk, the place I dumped the tincture. One of the girls was walking back and forth up the sidewalk spraying the rocks under the windows with Lysol. I watched it for a while and more came out. One opened the window and pulled the screen off and wiped it all down. Eventually a maintenance guy showed up. Then the gas company. I kinda started to panic at that point. I felt kinda bad, like maybe I had gone too far. I don’t think they ever figured it out or suspected me. For the next 2 months those windows stayed shut and I barely heard anything from them. It was so peaceful. I couldn’t believe it worked.",billynotrlyy,https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1infm0b/i_poured_skunk_tincture_all_along_my_neighbors/

confession,I work with the elderly. And I can’t bloody stand them. (self.confession),"I work in a care home. Challenging behaviour, aggression, dementia, schizophrenia, health issues, bed bound, nursing, the lot. 80 plus residents, 4 units. I didn't realise until I worked in care how rude, arrogant, entitled, nasty, racist, homophobic some elderly are. Out of all 80 plus only about 8 are actually decent. They are so disgustingly rude it's unbelievable and this is even the ones who are non dementia. Dementia crowd are a different breed. Some of lovely, some are the most awful people I've ever met and before you guys go crazy and scream but it's their dementia!!!! Yes. Some of it. But there's still a human being under the dementia and there's no way calling one of my black colleagues a monkey, n*ga, wog and specifically attacking them for being black (or our Indian ladies) is new to them. That's been there for decades. One guy looked at one of our new african sponsorships and said ""get back on your banana boat and fuck off"" They treat us younger people literally like we are their maids, barking their every want at us when they can see we are busy. They hurt us, berate us, go out their way to make our job more difficult. One lady (non dementia) threw her dinner plate with her dinner on at me because I got her husbands sugar wrong in his tea. I was targeted and attacked my entire pregnancy. Zimmer frame to the stomach, punched in the stomach, spat at, had a carbon dioxide fire extinguisher sprayed at me when I was heavily pregnant, told I should be ashamed of my mixed race baby. One new entry came in and only lasted 4 hours before his previous care home was called to take him back as he chased me saying he wanted to kill me and my baby. I've had shit thrown at me, my hair pulled, dirty nails dug into my skin and scratched. Another guy threatened to rape my younger colleague which really upset her. They're just vile. I'm sick and tired of saying we need to respect our elders and they're sweet little innocent cuties. There's some really nice ones sure! And I absolutely love doing care with them. But the others are just so nasty. Edit: just an add on.. in my experience schizophrenic people (medicated) are the sweetest people ever. We have a gentleman who is on injections each month and he's a HUGE guy. Big, muscly, 6 foot plus. He's in his 60s and he's so lovely and often tries to protect female staff from other male residents. Our schizophrenic ladies have their moments but generally are really kind and really intelligent too.",Leading_Exercise3155,https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1k6m3ae/i_work_with_the_elderly_and_i_cant_bloody_stand/
confession,My mom caught my dad with a 16yo and covered it up. (self.confession),"Well, 16 years ago we had two of my friends and their mother living with us while they went through a divorce. I was 15 and my friends were 14 and 16. I was away at another friend’s house one night. When I came back the following day my mom told me she had kicked them out because the 16yo tried to make a move on my dad. She absolutely slandered that poor girl’s name. When I got into my 20s it still sat in the back of my mind. I just knew I didn’t get the truth. So I reached out to the 16yo who was also now in her 20s. We met up and I got the true story. I could see the pain in her eyes. She said she’d been in therapy for years because of my father. That he did it in such a loving way, it really fucked her up. She told me they’d been drinking on the property then went skinny dipping. All while my mother was in bed pregnant with my sister. They made their way into the house and upstairs. Where eventually my mother walked in on them. I let her know I had her back if she ever decided to do anything about it. I am now in my 30s and recently became a mother and it’s all I’ve been able to think about. They still don’t know that I know the truth. It’s reawakened the rage in me. Especially all of the teenage rage they made me shove down for so long. Because if anyone did that to my daughter, or if I caught my husband in that situation, HELLLLLLL NO. It was easy to shove down before because I learned from the best, my parents. But becoming a mother, especially to a daughter, I’ve never wanted someone to pay for something they’ve done so bad. I feel like if I brought it up to my mom she would just get angry and talk shit. She’d probably say the past is the past and I need to let it go. That people can change. But I know he hasn’t changed due to events over the recent years with his anger and control issues. He’s a very big narcissist who believes he can do no wrong whatsoever. And my mother is so far up his ass. It makes me wonder if the 16yo was his only victim. If she was, and if he’s never done it again, would that be okay? Is this forgivable? Because I don’t feel like it is. I want to tell the whole family, but I feel like they’d just downplay it and make me seem crazy. Cut me off and turn my siblings against me. They’ve done it before when I called them out on other things. So, here I am. Just needing to get it out I guess.

She wanted a Frappuccino. She went to the bathroom while we were making the new order. I switched with my coworker and made the drink. Instead of almond milk I made the Frappuccino with regular milk. The drink was ready by the time she left the bathroom. She takes the drink and takes a sip and didn’t complain. 5 hours later she calls the Starbucks from the hospital and I was the one who picked up.

confession,"After 13 years clean and 8 years of marriage, I did heroin 3 weeks ago and almost came close to fully relapsing.Remorse (self.confession)","I was a heroin addict in the lower east side of Manhattan in the 1990s as a teen. I got clean at 21 years old after years of abuse. I got married at 26 to my amazing and beautiful wife. She knows I was an addict. I spent all these years not even really thinking that much about the concept of relapsing. It had been so long. I still thought about it, but with marriage and my kids and everything the thought of it was just so ridiculously out of sight to even consider trying it again. 3 weeks ago, it was my friends birthday. He is 4 years younger than me so of course he wants to go to some cool hip sketchy bar/club thing in bushwick. I got drunk, really drunk. I hadn't really drank much at all in the past few years so my tolerance was way lower than expected. There was a dealer outside and a few other junkies nearby. I don't even fully remember what happened, I just remember going with them, abandoning my friend at the bar (it was like 1am anyways), and going to some apartment and shooting up. I spent the night there, then all the way until noon the next day. I had 10 missed calls. I panicked when I came out of my daze. I told my wife I had gotten way too drunk and was puking and my phone was out of battery so I stayed at Charlies house. She was disappointed I didn't tell her but also thought it was funny because she used to tease me for not being able to handle my liquor. This was a ""I told you so"" moment, she had told me not to drink too much before I went to the bar. She wasn't even in new york, she was at a summer house with the kids in Massachusetts. I spent the next 4 days until they got back just... riddled with anxiety, urges to get more heroin, horrific mind zaps (I dont even know what to call them). It was, in some ways, worse than my withdrawal symptoms when I first was an addict. Not because of the physical feeling, but the horrible mental feeling of what I was possibly giving up, my wife and kids. I wanted to fucking get more so badly. I left my house to find heroin 4 fucking times. 4 times, I gave up to get more, but wasn't able to find any and snapped back to reality and went back home. I still thank FUCKING GOD I did not somehow run into some street dealer during those 4 times. I would have absolutely done it. I feel like everything I thought about myself, that I was strong, that my addiction was behind me, that I had beat heroin... it was all gone. I am not going to say I am back at square one or anything, I am not. But I feel like something inside of me has reset. My unwavering strength against addiction was broken at the slightest temptation. I still am weak. Heroin is so, so much stronger than me. Its truly unbelievable how much stronger it is than me. When I was young, my aunt had cancer. She beat it. Then it came back soon after, and she beat it again. It didn't come back, and we loved how strong she was for fighting her cancer and that she had overcome it. She lived with us. I remember her feeling of strength after her 2nd year of not having cancer, her 3rd year, her 6th year.... it finally felt like it was gone for good. Her thinking ""its finally behind me now, its a part of my past"", and then it just fucking came back. 9 years after her first diagnosis, it came back and killed her. I remember her feelings and how she felt about it. So many years after she thought it had gone away. That is how I feel. Like a cancer which I thought I got rid of a decade ago just showed back up on my screening. The first 5-6 days after I tried it that time outside the bar were the worst. My kids and wife have come back. The urges mostly went away the second I saw my kids. I hugged them so damn hard. And I never told my family what happened, nor will I ever. My wife never understood that side of me, she met me 5 whole years after I was clean. I just cannot have her know, ever. I won't do it again. I am planning on not drinking to excess like that again, except maybe in very specific situations like at the summer house where there is no option of drugs. I mean, not like I WANT to get drunk again like that, but just in case I ever want to get loose? I am never doing that in the city again. I am still about 90%+ sure that I won't ever touch heroin again. I am still positive in myself about it. Its just... it used to be 99% sure. That is what fucking terrifies me. I said heroin is stronger than me. It is absolutely stronger than me. But the reason I won't ever do it again is that it isn't stronger than my family, my wife and kids. I don't care about how good it feels, I will not subject my wife and children to me being an addict. I would rather just kill myself than that.",olrrtentr292,https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/9ps7y9/after_13_years_clean_and_8_years_of_marriage_i/
confession,8 years ago I caused a UFO panic (self.confession),"One college summer break 8 years ago my friends and I were bored. We remembered a demonstration from a high school science class of a ""Solar Balloon"". This was just a really thin black plastic bag you'd fill with air, seal, and then set out in the sun. The sun would heat the air in the black bag and the bag would become buoyant and float. We had the idea to find the cheapest/thinnest black plastic trash bags available and combine a bunch of them to make a huge balloon. We spent a few days driving around to Walmarts and dollar stores trying different brands to find the thinnest possible plastic bag and thinnest tape which would work the best. Finally we took a number of them, cut off the bottom ends, and taped them together into a huge balloon which we filled up with a leaf blower and then tied the end. After sitting out in the sun for a half hour or so we had done it! This is a picture a friend had taken as it was just becoming buoyant. We had to mess around with how the tape was sealing the bags to use as little of it as possible as the weight of the tape added up and made the balloon harder to float. Shortly after this the balloon got away from us Further This was dissapointing, but we made another one and got funny looks from cars driving by and were entertained for a bit. Shortly after that this new balloon met it's demise smacking into a tree and getting popped. Oh well, mission success. A few years later I happened across this news article. The balloon that got away had apparently blown a town over and caused a big UFO panic. People were calling 911, the police, and local radio stations about it. Our boredom unintentionally created a UFO panic in central NJ. I moved out of the area but when I get together with my friend we always bring this up and have a good laugh. EDIT: Wow didn't really think this would gain much traction. Also didn't expect any NJ Redditors to have seen this let alone the author of the article to show up. Glad everyone thinks this is funny but that being said please don't go out and do this on purpose. EDIT EDIT: Wow first gold ever.

confession,I (20M) have been hiding tens of thousands from my parents for years (self.confession),"At the start of high school, I was pretty broke as many high school kids are. To gain more freedom I worked hard to start my career as a 3D artist, and I was making a couple hundred every few weeks at best during most of high school. Even with how little I made compared to how hard I worked; my mom and stepdad would pressure me to chip in for the groceries and mortgage payments. Keep in mind, we aren't poor or anything, we were middle class, and they just wanted more financial freedom for themselves so they can consistently go on luxury vacations. I also have a few siblings (now in the higher years of high school) who they also do the bare minimum for, not bad enough to where it's child neglect but definitely not great parenting considering none of us could focus on our studies while having to work. The creative industry is difficult and unforgiving, and I put blood sweat and tears into my work to get where I am at this age. I'm not going to let them pressure me into making any big contributions to their finances so that they can keep going on excessive vacationing sprees. Only me and my girlfriend know how much I really make. I have been saving tens of thousands of dollars without anyone else around me knowing. One day they'll find out how much I have, but for now I will bide my time and take advantage of as little financial burden as possible. Once they do, I'll simply move out and be done with them. EDIT: Thanks a lot for the advice and comments everyone! Just to clarify, I do of course take care of my own expenses and my siblings' (since I wouldn't want them to be overburdened like I was) - I am not pitching into the household bills because they don't deserve it.

confession,I faked my resume and now I'm in the shit..........Remorse (self.confession),"Throwaway account for obvious reasons. Since I started High School, my parents stopped checking in on my grades and their mentality was basically ""we don't care as long as you get into a good university"" and they've carried on this mentality to when I got into college and they didn't really checked on my grades and gave me free rein as long as I majored in the subjected they wanted and graduated on time with good grades. Well basically what happened was that I failed my first year and had to switch my major. I didn't tell them and they didn't ask so I thought as long as I got my shit together and not drop out I'll be fine. One day out of the blue last semester my dad asked me to write up a resume. I panicked and wrote up a resume but changed the GPA and major and made up some shit and thought I saved myself. Welp, this winter break my dad dropped it on me and told me he knows people in a big company, he gave them my resume and everything and wanted me to intern there. So I am fucked. They'll probably figure it out and let my dad know and I'll probably get disowned or something, and best case scenario they don't check and give me the job, and I have to live with the guilt that I got a job that I didn't deserve cause of nepotism, this shit is depressing as fuck and I'm typically an easy going guy but this whole ordeal is giving me anxiety like nothing else. I feel like an ass for failing and lying to my family about it and now I'm on the verge of being blown and I thought maybe making a post here will make me feel better but I honestly don't know. Edit: wow this has blown up. In all my years of Reddit, the post that gets blown up is a confession post with a throwaway account.. talk about a wake up call. Anyways, I try to read all the comments I can. Some of you tell me to play it off and fake it till I make it, some of you tell me to come clean, some tell me to just disassociate from my family and do my own thing, it seems Reddit is just as conflicted as I am.

confession,I snooped on the CEO's email account and got myself unfiredLight (self.confession),"A couple years out of college I worked as an analyst at a pretty small private equity firm. The CEO was one of the biggest assholes I've ever met. He was fairly young in his 40s, a multi millionare, and the type of guy driven solely by money with 0 business ethics. He'd do anything to get the upper hand in a deal regardless of who it screws over...contractors, employees...I even saw him seriously fuck over a long time family friend of his without any remorse. Anyway, aside from my analyst role, as it was a really small business (only about 20 people in the office, and then a bunch of people working remote), I also happened to be one of the only semi technology-literate people in the company. So like many of my generation, I became the defacto ""Millenial Office Computer Guy"" too. Despite my lack of qualifications I got put in charge of handling pretty much anything minor tech related. Setting up servers....fixing laptop issues...answering ""How do I convert this to PDF"" questions...even basic network security. They thought I was some sort of computer genius...but really I was just mostly winging it, Googling pretty much everything. But eventually I got legitimately pretty good at all the tech stuff. They gave me bigger tasks like planning all of the computer systems for their owned businesses, and supervising installs. I didn't get paid extra for any of this mind you. After a couple years of serious bullshit working there, I was pretty worn out. I wasn't progressing. I hated working for captain douchebag...he treated everyone like shit. I was pulling 12-14+ hour days with no overtime or performance bonus. And they weren't paying me nearly what they should have. I also hated being ""the tech guy"" and was depressed as fuck basically living in a cubicle. So I decided I full on had enough of the 9-8 life working for assholes....and I would start my own consulting business working for myself. However, instead of quitting right away, I figured it would be smart to first build up my client base on the side while I was still getting a steady paycheck. So thats what I did. I launched my company, and landed my first clients. As the workload increased, I slowly started spending more and more time working on my side business while at my office job. At first I was pretty low key about it. But eventually, it was blatant. As it was a super small company....I was the only one who knew how to do a lot of important tasks and operate some key internal systems. It was easy for me to tell my boss a project was taking a whole week to complete, that I actually finished in 10 minutes. Pretty soon I was spending 80% of my day working on my own stuff in the office. I'd even take calls for my side business clients at my desk. The rest of the time I was usually dicking around on Reddit or something. Of course, we had systems in place to monitor network activity. But I was the person in charge of monitoring it. This continued for a while. As my own business ramped up, I cared less and less about the office job. And since I hated waking up early, I began rolling into work late. At first it was only 30 minutes or so. Then it progressed to an hour. When my boss didn't reprimand me...it became clear how much they needed me there. I took full advantage of this. Before long I was arriving around Noon, working for a couple hours, then heading home. My coworkers werent happy, but I helped them with all of their tech problems and they hated the company too, so they kept their mouths shut about it. My boss eventually said something to me about all it at one point, but I just came in on time the next few days and then went back to coming in whenever I wanted. After more than 2 months of coming in 4-5 hours late, and working on my side business in full view of my asshole boss, I couldn't believe I wasn't fired yet. I deserved it and felt it was inevitable. On a hunch, I decided to do a little investigative work. As I was the ""tech guy"", I also had full access to the company email server. So I logged into the CEO's personal email account, and searched for my name. Lo and behold, there was a recent email thread between him, my direct boss, and some other team members with my name in the subject line. Obviously I open it. They're discussing my recent performance issues...the last email in the chain basically said ""If nobody has any objections, I will be terminating him at the end of the week"". 2 days from then. I wasn't surprised, but I decided there was no way I was going to let these assholes fire me. Although I didn't give a shit about that job, I didn't want to have a termination in my work history. I also wanted to keep getting paid for a while longer. Of course, I couldn't let him know I actually knew I was getting canned. So, I formulated a plan to perform a little inception reverse-psychology mind fuck on the CEO. The next day, one day before they planned to fire me, I requested a meeting with him to ""discuss my current performance."". In that meeting I sat down, and he asked me what I wanted to talk about. So I told him (paraphrased): ""Look, I know I've been a shitty employee lately. I'm sure you've noticed. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I've been kind of getting the feeling you guys are planning to let me go soon."" When I said that the shocked look on his face was priceless...he must have thought I was psychic to work that out on my own the day before it was going to happen. I remember him just saying something like “uhh"". I continued while he sat flabbergasted. ""So I'll be honest with you, My heart isn't in this job anymore. As you know, I'm an entrepreneur at heart...which I’m sure you can relate to. I want to start my own company. However, as you're aware, I have a lot of responsibilities here nobody else can do."" I then proceeded to list all of the things I did and projects I was working on. I could see it on his face when the realization sunk in of how screwed he'd be if I left suddenly. ""So here's what I propose. You don't fire me. I don't quit. I keep working here for a month, finish my current projects, and train whoever you want on everything I'm in charge of. After a month is up, I will continue to come in once per week until its complete. After that, if you still need me...you can pay me on an hourly project-by-project basis"". I intentionally mentioned the possibility of me quitting so he could feel like he ""won"" the negotiation, even though I technically had him by the balls. He paused to think for a minute, then said something along the lines of: ""Okay. You have a deal"". So, not only did I get myself unfired...I actually turned the company into a paying client. During that month, I continued doing pretty much whatever I wanted since I had an expiration date (while training my replacement as promised). After the month was up they hit me up regularly for remote task work . I charged them triple what I was earning while working there, and barely had to deal with the CEO. my client base was big enough I dropped them for good. ...after all that, the CEO still calls me up for advice/questions nearly 3 years later. These days I just blow him off saying ""Sorry, I'm too busy"". Edit: As it seems there’s some doubt that this actually happened (it did), figured I’d clarify a few points. 1) This was a very small company. The office had about 20 people in it, and several dozen more worked remote. If you’ve never worked in a small office before, I can assure you it’s pretty normal for employees to wear many hats and take on random roles outside their initial scope. It’s also pretty normal for them to be severely lacking with network security and controlling passwords. 2) I did not become some “computer genius” and never claimed to be (tho my company of technology illiterate baby boomers sometimes thought of me that way). I had decent basic working knowledge coming into the job, and picked up more over the several years I was there. For anything complicated (like wiring, hardware installs, advanced networking tasks etc) we hired outside IT consultants. But I was the guy who would source them, hire them, supervise them and learn the systems they put in place. And I just handled more basic tasks myself . We’re also not talking about enterprise level security here either 3) my consulting business has nothing to do with private equity. Im not going to reveal exactly what I do for privacy sake since this blew up, but it’s in marketing. I didn’t steal any of my old company’s clients when I left and don’t compete with them 4) yes, Im fully aware and admit I was an asshole, hence posting this in /r/confession. In fact I decided to start my own company because I hate working for other people without my own skin in the game. I’m not a great employee when I don’t care about what I’m doing. However, the guys running the company were pretty shitty people, and I did not feel that bad about it at the time. The thing I did have reservations about was snooping on the emails. I do not condoned invading privacy like that. However, he’d freely given me the passwords (so I could help him set up his outlook, forwarding, etc), and I felt me getting fired was inevitably coming soon.",InthrowSted,https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/atmizg/i_snooped_on_the_ceos_email_account_and_got/

confession,I purposely made a girl fail a test in elementary school. (self.confession),"I believe it was either 3rd or 4th grade. I kept noticing this girl would cheat off me and get the exact same score as me on every quiz or test. So I came up with a plan to make her fail a test. I purposely chose wrong answers on a multiple choice test, making sure she could see what I put. I put a small dot on the answer I actually thought were correct. I then acted like I was done and waited for her to go turn her test in. I quickly erased all my answers and changed to the ones I had dotted earlier. She had came back to our table and I could tell she was horrified when she saw me doing what I was doing. Long story short, she ended up failing the test and I got like an 80 something on it. I sort of rubbed it in too because I made sure to ask her how she did. I’ve only told a few people this story. One person told me it was kinda psychopathic so I felt kinda bad. But I just thought I was teaching a lesson or whatever I guess. I’m pretty sure it worked at least a little, cause she stopped cheating off me.",TlosingCag,https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1hq0eij/i_purposely_made_a_girl_fail_a_test_in_elementary/
confession,"When I was younger I saw a lady drop 100 dollars, I picked it up and used all of it on Yu-GI-Oh cards right in front of her (self.confession)","Basically, she dropped the 100 dollar bill in one of the isles of this game store. I picked it up and I remember wanting to give it back, but I was there to get Yu-GI-Oh cards (I had recently lost all my good cards to my friend in a bet) so this was a miracle of sorts to make a solid come-back. So I kept it, I thought the woman had left the store so I went to go purchase my cards, right as I gave my money to the cashier, she walks up behind me watching me buy my 100 dollars worth of Yu-GI-Oh cards (this isn't a normal thing to do). She said nothing though and I left before she went to go buy her items so I didn't have to see the look on her face when she realized. There is no doubt in my mind that once she realized she was 100 dollars short, she would make the assumption it was the kid in front of her in line who spent 100 on cards.

confession,I found my Brothers suicide note on Reddit and didn't tell anyone.Remorse (self.confession),"Throwaway account. [REMORSE] When I was around 14 or 15 I found my older brothers Reddit account because of a secret santa package that got sent to us. I of course wanted to snoop onto his account so I checked his history, and found all of his posts for the past month had been been to /r/depression One post mentioned how my family, including me, were out of town due to me playing sports. That was the night he said he would finally commit suicide. He mentioned either pills or knives and it still haunts me to this day. I was obscenely scared when I found this post, and was home alone and vowed to myself to never let anyone know that I found this. To this day, my parents do not know, and have tried to keep me in the dark about his struggles with mental health as much as they can, and my brother most definitely does not know. The only person who knows is my now long term girlfriend, and now you guys. I feel awful for never telling anyone in my family, and I feel like this has taken a toll on my own mental health, which in itself is not in a good state at all. I just want to thank whoever dissuaded my brother from commiting suicide that day. He doesn't know how much of a positive impact he's had on my life, and you kept him around so he could further that impact.",asdllklk,https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/84otb3/i_found_my_brothers_suicide_note_on_reddit_and/

confession,I’ve intentionally NOT cleaned our house for the past year (self.confession),"My husband claims to be a germaphobe, but lives like a slob. We separated (but never officially divorced) in 2020. I truly loved living alone with my pets, but am admittedly not the best housekeeper. Laundry is always piled up and the dishes don’t get washed until I can actually fill the dishwasher. I don’t sweep/mop as often as I should, but will make a generous effort if expecting company. So back in 2022 we reconnected and rekindled our relationship, and decided to move back in together. His OCD (which I have recently learned to call it) is extremely frustrating. He MUST wash or sanitize his hands after touching anything that’s been on the floor, money, his wallet, etc. I am required to do the same. Any piece of clothing that has been worn outside of the bedroom (ie. his “safe space”) even if only for an hour, has to go immediately into the laundry. He hasn’t had a legit job in over a year. Some under-the-table work for a while, started two different server jobs and was fired within a few weeks. I work full time and pay at least 90% of the bills (this was still the case before we split). So for the past year I decided that if he is gonna be a SAHH I’m not going to do the housework. Guys, our house is disgraceful and I’d be mortified if anyone came to visit. The floors haven’t been cleaned in months. The garbage is overflowing before it gets taken out. Last week we got a notice in the mail about our unkempt lawn. I cave in and clean the bathroom when he leaves skid marks in the toilet or when the sink or shower starts looking gross but I legitimately can’t tell if he just doesn’t notice these things, doesn’t care, or just knows that eventually I’ll take care of them so he won’t have to.",Tracyjeanbitch,https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1hoawin/ive_intentionally_not_cleaned_our_house_for_the/

confession,"For three years, I switched my partner's tea in the morning because I couldn't deal with his fake snobbery.Light (self.confession)","When my ex and I started dating, I used to make him a morning cup of tea as a cute gesture and it stuck for the three years that we were together. It's a nice small thing you can do to make someone's day and and it's a nice way to get to know how someone likes things doing. So, my morning tea used to be any old teabag (Yorkshire tea if it was on offer), a splash of milk, and the first cup always had a teaspoon of sugar; every cup after was just tea and milk. My ex however had to have a very specific ritual: Thompsons Punjana tea, a teaspoon of milk and absolutely no sugar. He was adamant that he could tell in a heartbeat when his morning cup of tea and at the age of 33, he's never liked any other tea other than Fortnum & Mason's Royal Blend. So, in the beginning when he would stay at mine, I entertained this notion and used to make his morning tea the way he liked: Thompsons Punjana tea, a teaspoon of milk and absolutely no sugar. He would always thank me and tell me that I make the best cups of tea and it was nice, three times a week didn't kill me and it was a sweet gesture. Fast forward three months when he would spend nearly everyday of the week at mine (but not moved in), he was very demanding of his morning ritual and being a student, I couldn't keep affording to buy that brand of tea; besides, what was wrong with PG tips or any non-branded supermarket tea? Tea is tea after all. So, I used to always make his cup of tea with any tea bag, a teaspoon of milk and no sugar. I was always sure to only make it when he was in the shower or still in bed so he could never catch me out and initially, he was dubious and was always asking to make sure it was Thompsons Punjana tea (he used to call it by it's full name to emphasise how good it was). after a few trials of different teas, I finally found that sweet point where he couldn't taste the difference. I would drink it with him and as he sipped, would go on about how you can taste the quality and that there is really no other tea like it. When we moved in with each other, it was a lot harder to disguise the fact that I was keeping the same box of tea and just filling it with regular tea bags so I had to be a bit more clever. At the time, I was studying at college so I was in control of weekly food shops and only really wanted to go twice a week to minimise costs so we had more to spend on meals out. I used to buy one bag of his tea and two bags of mine a week and kept them in the drinks cupboard. When it came to making his in the morning, I would take one of his teabags and put it in my pocket, giving him one of mine instead and I used to give my tutors at college his tea to drink during the day. He would always comment that I run out quicker of my tea bags because of the quality and that with Punjana, one bag is enough for a considerable amount of time; little did he know. This went on for a couple of years and I never told anyone about it out of fear that he would find out, as after all, he really couldn't tell so why ruin the fun? It was saving me money and it was sort of amusing. I never let him make a cup of tea unless I was away so he never really had to find out. After we split up, we remained good friends and I've spent some time with him too in our old flat. Every time I visit, he always asks me to make a cup of tea the way I used to for old times sake because everyone he's been with or dated after me can never ""make it taste the way I did"". He even says that when he makes it himself with Punjana that he could never make it taste right and that I was some sort of special tea maker. I still haven't told him. This is a long post about tea so the TLDR: ex used to play on that he was very fussy with tea, I switched his morning cup to a considerably cheaper tea bag and he could never tell the difference and still can't.",evrrtt,https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/950fmp/for_three_years_i_switched_my_partners_tea_in_the/
confession,I took a shit in my roommates $300 Uggs because he had sex with my boyfriend on my bed when I was in a psychiatric hospital after a suicide attemptSupport Only (self.confession),"I didn’t even know my ex was into dudes Edit: this was 3 or 4 years ago and I’m currently in an amazing relationship with a very kind man. Thanks for all the support so far guys it means a lot. I’ve come a long way but man, those days were rough. I do feel a tinge guilty about how I reacted, so I appreciate you guys here giving nothing but love. Edit 2: Wow was not expecting this to blow up. For those of you saying I need help, trust me I get that. I was in a very dark place at the time. And I was VERY drunk while doing all of this. I ended up going to rehab and am happily sober now. My life has IMMENSELY changed for the better and I handle things way better now! Edit 3: For those of you wondering why I “let the ex off easy”- honestly I should have guessed he wasn’t that into me. I just wanted him bad and deep down knew he was using me for a place to stay/food/my car/etc. I got myself into that situation. It was a really rough time and I had literally 0 self respect. What really broke my heart was my best friend betraying me like that. I did kick the ex out and he was homeless/without a car/etc so he didn’t get off easy that’s for sure. But at the same time the pain from him cheating was absolutely nothing compared to the realization that I lost my best friend. Edit 4: also I realize my title was very confusing and long winded lol. For those confused, I’m a female. My roommate was a confident gay male. I didn’t know the guy I was dating was in to dudes Edit 5: I apologized to my old roommate and vice versa. We are both in better places and good friends again. I forgave him and he forgave me, this charade was years ago and we have moved past it Okay last edit: To whoever gave me gold, that’s so sweet I honestly did not expect this reaction.

Last night my friend and I went to a concert an hour away. We got there early and decided to get something to eat. We shared some spicy Korean fried chicken and a panini. We get to the concert, and about an hour in… I thought the smell (a straight up sausage and bell peppers smell) was my friend burping or something?? a little while later, the smell comes again. I’m confused. we were talking, she didn’t burp, so I’m like, ok someone else around is probably burping or literally eating bell peppers LMAO. The smell was so random and brief, but so consuming. Time passes, the smell appears once more, she says something along the lines of “I keep smelling bell peppers” and I’m like “oh my god me too???” We had a laugh when we were able to finally hear one another leaving the theater, and head home. All is well. Writing this now, the day after. The smell was me. I just farted, and yea. I was shocked lmao. Spicy food can upset my stomach sometimes, and tbh I don’t think I even fully noticed I was slipping out farts at the function because I was so overwhelmed, and when I did discreetly let one out I did not imagine it was that smell somehow?? 😭 So yea.

I do not have a “loose butthole” 😌 I was not thinking clearly bc I was overstimulated. when I tell you I truly was sooooo sure it could not be me producing the smell bc it didn’t even smell like a fart. my brain was just dissociated so I wasn’t putting 2 and 2 together that the smell was me, which sounds dumb, I’m aware, but it’s what happened lmao. I knew I was farting, it was just an afterthought. Do you really remember every time you fart? I know bell peppers aren’t spicy, I never said they were. I said the fried chicken I ate was. I didn’t even eat bell peppers. I have no idea how my fart smelled like that The smarty farties who are being bummers in the communal fart chat, I hope you go to fart and it’s poop.

confession,I lied to a blind neighbor and told him I moved away (self.confession),"Many years ago, I was standing on one of my balconies when a taxi driver was obnoxiously blowing his horn out front and yelling for a blind man to ""walk toward my voice"" from his own townhouse.

I made the mistake of giving the blind neighbor my phone number so that I could give him a ride in the future. Then the phone calls came... and never stopped. And when I gave him a ride, he would ask for various detours. I'm very calculated by nature, if he had told me beforehand where he wanted to go, it would be cool, but no... we'd be driving along and he'd throw in 2 - 3 extra places on each ride. And it came to be every day that he wanted rides... and he'd even call me to remind me to give him a ride, not that was ever late or backed out. Finally I had enough, so I gauged how blind he was.

confession,When I nannied I would read the journal of the mom. (self.confession),"I was only 20 years old and I nannied for this little baby boy. The mom seemed off. She would sleep the entire time I was there in the mornings , or go on three hour runs, or sometimes would just go about her business around the house- completely ignoring me. One time we both sat in the living room while the baby was sleeping in his room- I was reading a book (studying) and she sat there eating McDonald’s and watching her show. She did not say a word to me the entire time. Well, one day when she was out I snooped around and found her journal- I read the whole thing. Then got sad for her- she was so unhappy in her marriage and in life. I ended up working for her for three years and we became close. But that first year was so uncomfortable and awkward. In retrospect, it seems very obvious that she was suffering from post pregnancy depression. Edit: thanks everyone for the positive comments; I honestly was not expecting that- I just wanted to confess. For those of you who think I’m a horrible person for doing this, that’s ok. It was over 15 years ago and it still weighs on my mind that I invaded someone’s privacy. I felt bad about it then which is why I tried to repay by helping, but yes I did invade someone’s privacy and that’s not cool, I’m certainly not saying what I did was ok. Hence, the confession...

confession,"In the 2nd grade, two women with clipboards sat in on our classroom for a week “just to observe”. They were there, specifically, to observe me. (self.confession)","I’ll (32f) never forgot the time two grown women were introduced to our class as 'observers' for the week—“they’ll be in the back watching me teach for a few days. In order for them to do their job properly, please ignore them! Act like they’re not here.” They sat silently in the back taking notes on their respective clipboards for an hour or so each day. On that Friday, my teacher keeps me back during recess, telling me the two women want to chat/ask me some questions. I was then placed in a chair directly facing them, with my teacher and her aide standing off to the side a few steps behind the duo. Something was up. They then proceed to tell me, delicately, why they’re here. They go on to explain that my teacher knows I’m a good student and so my recent failing test grades don't make sense. They then show examples of me spelling the same words, or doing the same math accurately on previous tests/assignments, yet completely wrong with recent ones. “Have you been failing these tests on purpose?” This was the first time I experienced that heart-beating-out-of-my-chest type feeling. For one, it was TRUE, I was faking it. On top of that, they seemed VERY serious, scary serious, especially to my 8yo self. I, shamefully, admitted that yes, I had been. And when they asked why — well, that answer (the truth) led to my first (non-parental) authoritative-scolding on memory. Simply, I did it because I was jealous of the kids who seemingly got to have a second recess There was group of 20 or so students across the six 2nd grade classrooms who got pulled each week for roughly half the day. One day I saw them playing outside from inside the classroom. They appeared to be having soo much fun, and I wanted in on the fun. So I asked one of them how they got put into that group and was told, “because I’m bad at spelling and math”. Ugh, my two strongest subjects. What am I ever to do? Dumb myself down, of course! To become one of them, I had to act like them, think like them, test like them. After our lil’ interview sesh, my failed attempt at manipulation - whatever you wanna call it - was never discussed of again. My parents never questioned me about it (to this day I don’t know what they know/were told, if anything at all), my peers never knew about it, and I never told a soul. Those women scared the living daylights out of me.",PerizzHilton,https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1gucna0/in_the_2nd_grade_two_women_with_clipboards_sat_in/
confession,I lied on my resume and the company that made an offer noticed.... (self.confession),"I often fudge on how much I know of a thing. Maybe I worked with the software for a few weeks 3 years ago and used if just fine. They want expert level - I say I'm expert. I get the job and all I do is login, pull data, and log out. Less than I did 3 years ago. (UPDATE AT THE BOTTOM) 99% of the time, as a contractor, I don't even do what they hired me for. I do a job that's beneath me. Here's what they do: Let's call them a fake name of ""ABC Fargo"" or ""XYZ Bank America"" ""ABC Fargo"" company has a need for someone to create spreadsheets and process maps documenting a network topology. They've had flakes in the role before - technical people who have no interpersonal skills and no business acumen, they work slow, don't understand the big picture, they don't keep people updated, etc. Maybe paying them $45/hr So they hire me, an IT PROJECT MANAGER with a background 20+ years ago as a Data Network Engineer. Paying me $90/hr giving me the title of Applications Program Manager with a fancy job description with a bunch of shit I won't be doing, but ONE LINE in there that says I need to know how to document a network. They figure they will aim high, pay high, just so they can be sure to get someone that can work well with other departments to gather the information, keep everything on schedule, and not drop out of sight, and do clean efficient work. They don't care about my career and that this job is a step backwards, and when I go to get my next job as a Project or Program Manager, it makes me look bad if I say what I was REALLY doing. They figure the pay is so high, I'm working from home, by the time I figure it out, I'll stay for the money - which I do. But my skills don't grow. So yeah, I lie on my resume. Yeah I did extensive and complication project management for ABC Fargo for a year with budget, and tollgates, and scrums, and project plans, and clearing roadblocks. No way I'm going to say I just did spreadsheets and visio diagrams day in and day out for a whole year. This has happened on the last 6 contracts I have worked. They lie, I lie. We're even. So I keep the fancy job description, I make up project accomplishments. Everything on there I know how to do, it's just not 100% honest. So this time, I was finding it hard to find another role since my last contract completed April 2024. So I started fudging the dates so it looked like I did less contracting and stayed places a little longer. Sometimes contracting make you look flakey, but the money is GOOD! Soon as I changed up the dates, I got interview. Literally the next day after I started using the fudged dates. In my experience, that initial resume never seems to make it to HR - they look at the APPLICATION. I never lie on the application. Dates and titles are correct. I leave the job duty stuff though- they can't verify that. I've never been called on it until last week. People are often incompetent and it usually works in my favor. They're not paying much attention in how they do their jobs. I'm posting now because it's all complete and I started yesterday. Here's how it went down: One of the recruiters for the agency was getting on my nerves calling me all day asking for information he could have just put it all in an email at the end of the day. He wanted to to a mock interview and I told him to take a hike, I'm old as fuck and don't need interview help. I think he got offended and decided to try and trip me up. He has never called or emailed me since then - his boss does. (I have an interview to contract for ""EFG Sachs"" I have worked for this agency before at ""XYZ Chaser Banker"" in 2023. So they only need to verify the last contract I had after 2023 right? Nope. Somehow they are verifying EVERYTHING all over again. I get an email from the HR/Background Check person: ""You resume says this, but your application says this."" I was like... Oh shit. It's finally caught up with me. It was a Friday afternoon, so I let it lay and took time to figure it out the weekend. I was prepared to lose the offer, so that made it easy to be confident about my response. Which was plainly and simply: ""I recently had my resume professionally rewritten and it looks like I didn't double-check the dates. Everything on the application is correct and verifiable."" No apology, no long-winded explanation. They accepted that and everything moved forward with them verifying. Whether they thought I was lying, I don't care. I got an email a few days later: ""Background check complete."" All of a sudden, last Friday, I get an email: ""Background check reopened."" (gaslighting language, right?) I was like... what is it now? I know the application was correct. Maybe they escalated to a manager about the resume and don't want to take a chance and upset their client ""MNO Sachs"". Because if ""MNO"" wants to take me permanent as an employee, they will do their own verification and the agency would be on the hook. Turns out, two of my old positions could not be verified - 1 wasn't answering and the other had sold and merged with another firm. So I sent them W2s for those two roles. See? That's why I don't lie on the application. SIDE NOTE: They wanted me to either send pay stubs or W2s or give them access to my taxes. If they got access to my taxes, they'd see the times I was working for two companies at the same time! When I worked for them and ""ABC Fargo"" remote, I also worked remote for another company remote. It was the tail end of COVID and I needed to make up for the times I had no contract. But I wasn't doing the work I was hired for, I was doing dumb work that wasn't challenging, so I worked two 8-5s at once - succeeding at both. So use caution when showing them your taxes - they get to see EVERYTHING that's not their business. The IRS sends your transcripts directly to them!!! Total invasion of privacy. So I won out on the application verification and started work yesterday (2 days in the office 3 at home - which leaves me room to do another contract, as I expect I have been lied to on this one as well). I've been out of work since April and today is my last unemployment filing - There's only $57.65 left of my claim. 99% of the time, you won't get caught. But be prepared for that one time. I'm 50+ and this is the first time I ever got called on it, and I firmly believe I was targeted because I told the dude to chill. I've even lied about a degree out of frustration and it got me the interview. If I can interview, I'll get an offer. Do what you have to do to get that interview - don't take it too far and lie completely - fudge the dates and the titles and the duties. Don't straight out lie about working somewhere you didn't, or put duties you have no idea how to perform. Everything on my resume I can do. TIPS If it's been a while, look at some YouTube training to get back up to speed or be able to discuss intelligently. Jot down keywords and definitions on your printed job description. Always print out the JD and take notes on it - and have cliff notes as well. Include buzz words like business partners, team members. Google Interview buzzwords and jot them down on the JD or on sticky notes somewhere you can glance at them during your video interview. Ace the interview by acting as though you already work for the company, you're just going to be working with a different department. Introduce yourself, ask them about how you can help, what they need you to do,. Say we and our and us and shit like that. Trick them into it. Use their names (jot them down doofus - I'm bad at names too). ""You know, James mentioned earlier that he'd had a hard time getting the last person in the role to respond to emails. I understand what that can mean to you being able to complete your part of the work. I am mindful that my part affects someone else's work. But if you aren't getting what you need, please let me know, and I hope I can do the same. I value my team and don't mind having a tough conversation and hitting the reset button. Tell me, Sarah (manager), what are you most proud about when it comes to your team?"" ""Mark, you work closely with this role and you shared what you would need from me if I were to join the team (see how I did that?). What are some things you don't want to see? (They LOVE this! They'll say: ""Not double-checking the reports, not responding in time for weekly reports, not admitting when something is not understood, etc."") Just be relaxed and conduct yourself like you're in a conference call to work on a special project for a company you already work for. Tell them about you, ask about them, ask about the work. It will make you seem like part of the team, not some nervous weirdo acting like you're from Mars. Oh - one last thing. ""If I don't know something, I'll say I don't know, but I can find out and get back to you by end of business. Or let's set up a meeting and find out together and come back and let the team know"" No one should ever just say I don't know and leave it at that. They were asking me some word and acronym definitions, and on one of them I was like: ""I know about the subject, but I may not know the formal terms you're using, so let me give you my best guess. Risk control is different from risk mitigation in this way: ""Blah, blah... is that what you were looking for? If I were on the team and someone asked me that, I'd give my best answer and tell them I'd check it out more and follow up by a specific time."" I don't know all the answers, but I know how to find them - that's the key. Well, I know it's a novel, but I hope it helps... UPDATE: People are DMing me asking about my career path and how I chose it. I just started with a job and based on what I liked most, I grew that part and sought a job doing more of what I liked. In 1994 I worked as a staffing manager getting people temporary jobs - making $8.75/hr and placing people making $10+. We had to test them on software. A lot of people were great but didn't know the software, so I trained them on the side without permission and wrote some procedures/cheat sheet they could take on the job - they all got offered perm jobs - just needed a chance. I liked training, so I went after a job training and eventually got one. I lied on my resume to say I did training as a regular part of my job - a little fudge. I was training network engineers on software, then graduated to training how to engineer a piece of equipment - I went from $18,200 to $35k/yr with no degree. Then I learned how much engineers made and since I could train someone how to engineer, I took a job as a network engineer because of the money. When I was a network engineer, I worked with project managers a lot. So, I looked for jobs project managing network projects. I had never done project management as a role, but I had seen it done over and over. So I lied on my resume and said that I had done project management. I then studied project management and got certificates and then got a Jr. Project Management job. September 11th hit and I was laid off. I created a shitty web site to advertise my training that I developed and became self employed. The training was for people who had gotten jobs but didn't know how to use software. I volunteer at an after school program that tutors elementary kids and they have a computer lab. The founder let me use it on the weekends. Which is when working people can come in to train. The city sent about 400 people over the course of a year into 2002. Long story short (I am capable) people kept asking me to do a web site for them. So I taught myself web development and coding. I already knew database/SQL and command line from my training and engineering roles. Web sites got easier for people to do themselves with Wix and more small businesses shifted to free pages on Facebook. Originally, Facebook did not allow businesses. So as my 15 year web business died, I saw a technical writer job in 2017 at a bank and became a technical writer - having written documentation in one form or another all my previous roles. I wrote policies and procedure documentation for everything and often came in contact with risk, compliance, audit. You have to keep your eyes open and not be that dumb person that only knows their own job and likes saying ""I don't know, that's not my department."" From 2017 to now I have accepted roles with the most money ($75-90)/hr that I can get hired for. I have been Project Manager and Program Manager for IT and Risk, I have been Documentation Manager - I pursue Enterprise IT roles because IT pays more than Operations. The job I started a couple days ago bounces me back down to Technical Writer, but in the job description and interview I learned this is a new department. This means I will have an opportunity in the next year to be back in Program management. I'm contract with a lot of experience, so my pay is the same as my IT and I work remote 3 days a week. (I prefer full remote) There are so many lies about job descriptions, I don't chase some pie in the sky career. I need money. I am 54 years on come June and have had great experiences but mostly terrible job experiences - I am still in touch with my Instructor and Network Engineering pals (co-workers and students) from 1997-2001 - best jobs I've ever had. Nowadays 80% is co-worker drama/politics and 20% is actual work.

Whenever a middle aged woman, who clearly looks older than 21, purchases alcohol from me, I intentionally ask them to show me their ID.

confession,I plagiarised my entire dissertation and I got caught. (self.confession),"It just felt too big, too nebulous. I had no idea where to start. I kept putting it off and putting it off again, with no idea of what to do. I could have asked for help, but I didn't. How pathetic, I thought - every other student can manage to write one, but you need help? Just fucking put your head down and do it. But I didn't. With 24 hours to go, I had nothing. So I found a dissertation on Google, and I went through and changed it enough that I thought I could get away with it. I didn't. I have a hearing in a few days, and I can't see any likely outcome other than being kicked out with no degree. I haven't told anybody, besides a nice woman on the phone from Samaritans, because I didn't know who else to call. She didn't seem to know what to say though, and I can't blame her. What is there to say? You fucking idiot? How did you not ask anyone for help at any stage? Why are you the only person who can't fucking write their own dissertation? I'm so ashamed. So so ashamed. I can't tell my friends. Students have fun at university, but I feel as though there is an unspoken contract that everyone can do so because they are all working hard. I have broken my contract, and I cannot admit it. This shame pales in comparison to the shame I feel regarding my parents. I am dreading telling them more than anything. They have been nothing but supportive my entire life. They are wondeful people. They have given me so much help, sacrificed so much for me to get a good education, and I have spat in their faces.

confession,"I stole my friend's folder in 3rd grade, and looking back I deserved to get sent to a mental hospital for what I did. (self.confession)","A little backstory to showcase little me. My parents divorced in second grade and something snapped inside of me. Every minor inconvenience in my life became worthy of a tantrum. Screaming at my parents telling them I hate them. Threatening to jump out of Windows. Once the cops even came to my house because I screamed so often my neighbors thought I was being abused. One day in third grade, I don't remember why, I snuck under my desk and into the backpack of the girl sitting across from me. I took her folder and put it in my bag. It was towards the end of class and she told our teacher who asked me to return it. I went into a rage screaming that I didn't steal it, and how dare she accuse me. I gripped my desk, and a security guard and my vice principal carried me out of my class as I kicked and screamed. I was sent to the principals office, where I kept screaming how I hated life, and I wanted to die, and I wanted my parents to die. My parents were called, and I was taken to a hospital where I spent the night, then the next morning I was carried, kicking and screaming into an ambulance. I remember my mom sitting there crying as I screamed every curse word I knew at her saying it was her fault, and I was going to pee myself if they didnt let me out. My time at the hospital they took me to was a blur, and when I was released I would be in therapy up until I graduated. I've always for some reason felt the need to defend myself saying it wasn't my fault and blaming everyone for freaking out on me. But I'm finally ready to say it. I stole her folder, and I was the one responsible for everything that happened after. Not my parents. Not the school. Not my classmate. I did it, and it feels so amazing to finally say it. Edit: Just because a lot of people are asking. 1. I don't remember wanting anything inside the folder, I believe I just took it because it was pretty. 2.My relationship is amazing with my parents now, and I have a apologized for a lot of what I put them through.",Habergirl2017,https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/gc2tgy/i_stole_my_friends_folder_in_3rd_grade_and/

confession,Was naked at my friends party for his kid high on morphine (self.confession),"In my late 20s and early 30s, I started making good money as a financial advisor, and it kinda led me into a bad crowd where we were drinking, doing blow, and it’s when I first got introduced to morphine. All while this happened, I started becoming more distant from my best friend, I’ll call him Ben. Anyways, Ben invites me to his 4-year-old daughter’s birthday party at his house. It was kinda an attempt to patch things up between us. The week I had was super long and stressful, and I had forgotten all about the party until I got a reminder from my phone. I was already with my other friends doing our usual thing when my buddy Chad got this new bottle of solution you take orally. I’d never tried it before, and nothing happened. I looked it up, and it said it was supposed to work in an hour, but nothing happened, so I assumed it was a dud. I Uber to Ben’s birthday party because I didn’t want to drive just in case it would affect me. As soon as I get to his house, it starts to creep up on me, and I’m feeling nice and relaxed, music sounds amazing, all that stuff. I had to go take a shit because it’s a common thing that happens to me when I take morphine. When I’m sitting on the toilet, that’s when it hits me like I got hit by a bus. My mouth is as dry as the fucking desert, my whole body is so nice and relaxed times 10. I’m not going to lie, it felt fucking amazing. In my head, I kept saying, “this is amazing, this is amazing,” over and over and over. I remember slumping the fuck over on the toilet and landing face-first on the bathroom floor. I don’t know how long I was lying there, but Ben’s wife knocks on the door and asked if I’m ok. I tell her I’m fine, but even saying it, I sound like an actual retard. I remember I’ve been in here for a while now, and it looks suspicious asf. My whole body feels heavy as shit, and I just want to lay down and enjoy my high. I try to stand up, but my legs are shaking like crazy, and it feels like I’m 2000 pounds. I manage to open the door after what felt like hours fumbling with the lock. I walk into the main room where everyone’s at. I remember the look of absolute horror on everyone’s face—Ben’s face, his wife’s, his parents, everybody. Me being high asf, I say, “What?” Ben says, “Pull your pants up, WTF are you doing?” I look down, and my dick is out. One of the little kids notices and just screams at the top of her lungs. Me being absolutely blasted, I say, “Shut up, you ole bitch” to a literal 5-year-old. I don’t really remember much after that. I just remember Ben taking me home, me begging him to take me to McDonald’s like a child and whining and crying when he didn’t, and him lecturing me about how much I changed and how much of a degenerate I’ve become. I feel absolutely horrible about ruining that girl’s birthday party, possibly traumatizing a bunch of kids, and having my best friend have to take care of me on a day he was supposed to remember fondly. I’m going to quit all drugs, try to make more meaningful relationships. I’ve apologized to Ben, but obviously, he doesn’t want to talk to me, which I understand.

Of course we skated away with them every bag to his garage. All the lotto tickets were winners. But we started noticing some were not punched with a hole. We went through thousands of tickets and 1 out of every 200-300 were not holed. We somehow convinced his dad to turn them into a local gas station for us. I remember his dad being kind of excited about it. He was quite a character. We went back to the same dumpster two more times, the third time. Padlock. I think we both walked away with $1000+ that summer. New skateboards are totally rad. UPDATE: My previously mentioned “buddy” saw this, recognized the story. And reconnected after 20+ years.

confessions,I stood by and allowed my wife to almost kill our son. I was happy she did it. (self.confessions),"Okay, fair warning, this one is long as hell. Apologies for that, but this is very hard for me and I have been carrying it for a lot of years. On the advice of my therapist, I’ve written it all out to try to work out my feelings on it. He didn’t advise me to submit it to Reddit of course, but I have struggled with this for a long time, and I need to hear other people’s opinion on it. I still really have no idea how I feel about it, even after all these years, but I will submit for judgment by the masses. I know I did wrong on some things, probably a lot of things. I tried to do my best that I could. My son was very troubled. VERY troubled. If you have seen the movie ""We Need To Talk About Kevin"", it will really help to understand what I'm talking about, because I swear to God when I watched that film I thought I was watching a documentary of my life, I felt like the writer must have had cameras hidden in my damn house, that’s how accurate it was. The only difference is that in the movie, the boy appears normal to his father and only reveals his true nature to his mother, with my son he didn’t have that mask. His insane behavior was the same with everyone. From the day he was born, my son just came out wrong. He was planned, my wife and I tried to get pregnant and were ecstatic when he was born. He was wanted and loved. We showered affection on him and really tried to give him a happy childhood. But from the day we brought him home from the hospital, he was miserable. He cried for 13 months straight. I’m not exaggerating, 13 months without a break, he cried until he had no voice left and kept crying, you could see his little face scrunched up and no sound coming out, totally hoarse. There were times he would literally be crying in his sleep, I’ve never seen or heard of any other kid able to do that. We brought him to doctors, specialists, tried changing his diet, held him, rocked him, toys, swaddling, music, mobiles, everything we could think of. Nothing worked. 13 months of grating, grinding, no sleep hell. Once he got over the crying stage, we thought we were out of the woods. But it quickly became clear that for some unknown reason, he was just angry at being alive. I never saw that kid have a genuine, joyous smile once in the time I knew him. I saw him grin a vicious, horrible grin many times, taking a perverse pleasure from causing pain or suffering or breaking a rule, but a smile from real pleasure at something nice? No, never. Not once. He had no interest in anything positive; he was fueled by hate, and everything he did was bent toward that. As soon as he could walk, his mission in life was to destroy things. He would break or try to break anything that came in his range, smash it, chew it, throw it in the toilet, whatever he could. After a while he figured out how to get his diaper off and took great pleasure in shitting and pissing anywhere he could. After a while he figured out he could hide it, and started pissing and shitting in places we wouldn’t find right away, grinding it into carpets making it even more of a problem to clean and making the house stink. When he got older, (ages 9-15) he would piss and shit in our bed, until we got a lock on our door and he wasn’t able to get in anymore; then he’d just take a dump in the hallway in front of our room. That biological warfare started around a 2 and a half years old and he never grew out of it. I’ll try to speed it up as I could literally go on for days about this stuff, but as he grew older, he became more and more unmanageable. He would bite, kick, scream, scratch and spit at anyone trying to do anything with him. He was kicked out of school twice before he was 9, then let him back in and then kicked him out for good, he had to change schools. The next one put him in a special class that kept him away from the other students. We had to install a door and lock on the kitchen because he would steal knives and use them to gouge the walls/furniture or chase people with them. When he was 10, he stabbed me pretty good in the hip and ass, I still have the scars. As he grew older, he grew darker. He moved into setting things on fire, and torturing local animals. There was a stray dog that hung out around the park near our house, my son blinded it in one eye with a BBQ fork. He would dip cat’s tails in gasoline and light them on fire. He became a violent, stinking, vicious beast that lived in our house. We couldn’t do anything with him. I will take this opportunity to preempt the tsunami of messages: YES, we had the kid in fucking therapy. He saw a psychiatrist twice a week, and had god knows how many different medications prescribed to him over the years. Nothing worked. Therapy didn’t work. Meds didn’t work. Nothing fucking worked. He was like a poison cloud of hate and fury lashing out at anything in his reach. When my son was 16, my wife got pregnant again. I can’t tell you how different our reaction was. Instead of joy, we felt horror. This pregnancy had not been planned, and we really were at a loss over what to do. My son had been such an unending nightmare for 16 years, we couldn’t take the idea of starting again from the beginning. We talked a lot about terminating, but a) access to abortion was not as easy in those days as it is now, and b) my wife was very against it. We talked about many options. In the end, we decided that my wife would have the baby, and if it turned out evil we would put it up for adoption. We knew we just couldn’t do it again with another child like our son. We had a daughter. She was normal. Suddenly we saw what our lives should have been like the whole time, how things would have been had our son not been himself. She laughed at things. She breast fed without biting (she didn’t have teeth yet anyway, but you could tell she was just trying to eat, not tear her mom’s breast off). After 4 months she was sleeping through the night. She was happy. She was NORMAL. I can’t describe the relief and happiness that we both felt, I don’t have the words for it. This where I believe I may have started really pulling back from my son. Up until that time, whatever mistakes I made, I had always tried to do the best for my son, I am convinced of that. I tried to help him and love him and care for him, I really tried. But when my daughter was born, my wife and I both instinctively just turned toward her. She became our focus, not from malice, but just because she was so much EASIER. She was so happy and sweet, every moment we were with her was like magic. I understand this was wrong, but we honestly couldn’t help it. I don’t have a better explanation than that. My son hadn’t given a shit about my wife being pregnant, I honestly don’t know if he really understood it, but when we brought our daughter home he started acting out even more. I didn’t think it was possible, but he took it up another notch. At this time he was 17, and we were having blow-out screaming matches daily. Usually after we fought, he would storm out of the house and disappear for hours at a time, or come back the next morning. It was a relief. I started to actually look forward to our fights because it would get him away from us for a while. After the birth of our daughter, my relationship with my son was almost entirely gone, our only real interactions were screaming at each other. My wife was even worse with him, she just had nothing left. By that time, if our son even came in to the same room as her, she would just stop whatever she was doing and start screaming “GET THE FUCK AWAY FROM ME! GET AWAY! GET THE FUCK OUT!” until he left. He started spending more and more time out of the house, which was a blessing for us. I have no idea what he got up to out in the world, but we were just happy it wasn’t being inflicted on us. As a consequence of our son’s behavior, we had invested heavily in locks around our house. All of the cheap, thin interior doors in our home had been replaced with think, dense wood doors that couldn’t be kicked through, equipped with keyed locks that my wife and I carried keys to. I know it sounds extreme, but locks and heavy doors were the best way we had found to create safe spaces from him. And again, before I am inundated with messages, I was not locking my son in rooms like a prisoner, he had free reign of the house and could come and go as he pleased. My wife and I would lock OURSELVES in rooms to protect ourselves from him, if anything WE were the prisoners in our own home. On the day in question, I had fought with my son in the morning and he had left the house in a rage. My wife and I were enjoying some peace and quiet in the kitchen while our daughter napped in our bedroom. And then my daughter began crying. Any parent who has young children can tell you, you get used to your child’s cries and you can tell after a while what they need, they cry differently if they are hungry, or need changing, or are just restless and want to be held. Babies can communicate pretty well before they can speak. This cry was none of those things. This cry was terror. The second we heard it my wife and I were both up out of our chairs and running to the room. The door was locked of course, and it took a few seconds to get the right key and get it open. My son was in the room. We lived in a bungalow, and the bastard had climbed in the window to get to her. He was standing over her crib with a steak knife in his hand. I have no idea where he got it, it wasn’t one of ours; we controlled our knives very carefully and always kept them in locked drawers. I think he may have stolen it from one of our neighbor’s houses. He had broken her skin twice already, once in the belly area and once on her arm. I could see blood running down. When I entered the room he was dragging the back of the knife down her face, not cutting, almost tickling her with it, teasing her while she screamed. He looked up at us and smiled. Before I knew what I was doing, I was already moving, running to put myself between them. I didn’t think about it, I just moved instinctively. Even with that, my wife got there faster, it was like a movie on fast forward, she got to our son and bashed his hand away, knocking the knife across the room and then shoved him with her whole body weight, so hard that he flew away from the crib and bounced off the wall. I picked up my daughter and held her while my wife screened us. I could see her shaking, almost convulsing. I can remember the smell of the room, the sound of my daughter screaming and wailing. The look on my son’s face as he stood there. Just nothing. Blank, dead, there was nothing in his eyes, no emotion. He looked like an alien to me. I watched my wife take a step toward him. I could have reached out and stopped her, but I didn’t. She stepped forward again, very close to him. I could have stopped her again. But I didn’t. She waited, looking at him for maybe 3 to 5 seconds without moving. And then she punched him in the face. Now until this point, you may have been picturing my wife as a typical woman, small frame, dainty, delicate. This is not the case. My wife does have a small frame, but dainty and delicate she is not, never has been since I’ve known her. Since her early teens, my wife has been a boxer. MMA didn’t exist back then, but karate and boxing were big in those days, and my wife was a VERY talented amateur. She was about 130 pounds, she carried a lot of muscle and she knew how to punch. I had 70 pounds on her back then, and I have no doubt that in a real fight between me and her she could have and would have pounded me flat. Neither of us had ever laid a hand on our son in anger before, but something broke in her that day, and all the years of anger and pain and sorrow and frustration just came pouring out. When she hit him his head snapped back and blood started pouring out of his nose. He hardly reacted, he just looked at her with this shocked expression like he didn’t know how to process what had just happened. She waited another second. And then she hit him again. I could have reached out and stopped her. I could have dragged her out of the room, taken her away, calmed her. I didn’t. I just stood there and watched while she systematically started to pound him to a pulp. Every time he brought his hands to cover one part she would blast him somewhere else, body, head, body, head, over and over. He started screaming, crying out, yelling for her to stop. It’s the most genuine reaction I’d ever seen him have to anything in his whole life. But she wasn’t stopping. I watched her ramping up, hitting harder, faster, working him like a heavy bag. He tried to swing at her and she slipped him easily. She was on auto pilot, sinking down into her training. I stood there watching for a minute. Then I turned my back on them and took my daughter out of the room. I brought my daughter to the kitchen and gave her a bath in the sink. I found that he had cut her a third time on the sole of her foot. All the cuts were superficial. I cleaned her up and held her until she calmed. I put Polysporin and Band-Aids on her cuts. In our bedroom, I could hear my son screaming, calling my wife horrible names, telling her he would cut her head off and fuck her corpse. After a while, I didn’t hear him saying anything anymore, didn’t even hear him crying out. I assumed that he must have been knocked out. But I could still hear her beating him. That went on for a long time. Long enough for my daughter to drift off to sleep in my arms. I just sat at the kitchen table waiting for her to finish. Finally she came out and sat down across from me. Her hands were swollen and red. Her face and arms were splattered with blood. Her chest was heaving. We just stared at each other without saying anything. After a while I asked her “Is he dead?” She looked back at me and answered “I fucking hope so”. I nodded. That was all there was to say about that. I understood how she felt perfectly. I felt the same. I didn’t know what to do, so we just sat there waiting silently. Eventually my wife started crying and went to go take a shower. I just stayed where I was holding our daughter. After a long while, I heard moaning and sobbing coming from our room. It turned out that my son wasn’t dead. I went in to see how bad it was, and it was… pretty bad. I’ve never seen a more merciless beating laid onto anyone, before or since. He was lying on the floor, rolling around with blood leaking out of his face, lying in a pool of vomit. His nose was squashed flat out across his face, both of his eyes were completely swollen shut and starting to blacken already. I could see that a couple of his fingers were bent out at weird angles and he had pissed his pants. I think he must have been missing teeth, but I couldn’t see any on the floor and I couldn't see inside his mouth, his lips were all puffed up and swollen. From talking to my wife about it later, I know now that she had systematically beaten every part of his body, focusing heavily on his legs. She told me she kicked him in the groin repeatedly until her legs got tired, and had kept beating his body long after he had passed out. When my wife came out of the shower, I still didn’t know what to do about our son. I didn’t know whether to call the police or an ambulance, take him to the hospital myself, I honestly didn’t have any idea what to do. After a while I realized that I simply didn’t care what happened to him anymore, and we decided to just let him live or die on his own. There was an in-law suite in the basement that we had never really used, and my wife, my daughter and I just moved down there. We simply ceded the top floor of the house to my son and locked everything down, separated our lives entirely. There was plenty of food in the upstairs cabinets, enough for a couple weeks or more, he had a washroom and bedrooms to use. We had a washroom in the basement, a small kitchenette, and a separate entrance so we just stopped going upstairs. We just decided we were done with him. I figured we'd let his food run out and see what happened. Over the next week we could hear him moving around upstairs sometimes. I think he just spent most of time lying in bed recovering. I went to work, watching on high alert in case he attacked me in the driveway, but he never did. My wife stayed home with our daughter. She was never out of our sight. One night we heard him going ballistic, smashing things and banging. We didn’t respond. He never tried to get downstairs or get near us though. I think he was afraid that if he got near us again, my wife might finish the job on him. After three weeks down in the basement, we hadn’t heard anything from up above for a few days, and I ventured upstairs to the main floor of the house. The place was demolished, and there was no sign of my son. He was gone. It took months to repair the damage he had done and get the main floor back to normal again. There was food and shit smeared all over the walls and broken glass on the floor, big holes in the dry wall, he had ripped the place apart. He tore up the linoleum in a corner of the kitchen and emptied an entire foam fire extinguisher into the living room. I feel thankful that he didn't burn the house down with us in it, I'm honestly not sure why he didn't, the kid wasn't shy about lighting things on fire. After that, I lived in fear every day that he would come back, that he would ambush us out of the blue and try to kill us. We moved house about 3 years later and I finally stopped being afraid that he would show up again, as now he had no idea where we were. I finally felt safe from him. All this happened a long time ago. My son was born in the spring of 1971, my daughter was born in ’88. I'm an old man now, I’ll be 70 this year and my wife passed from cancer in 2016. My daughter is 31 now, I moved in with her and her husband after my wife passed. I’ve got two granddaughters and they are the joy of my life. I see a therapist a couple times a month to talk about all this. I don’t know where my son is. The last time I saw him was when he was lying on the floor of our bedroom, bleeding and smashed. I haven’t heard from him since he left, more than 30 years now. I don’t want to. I carry a lot of guilt from that time, and a lot of conflicted emotions. I didn’t beat him myself, but I allowed him to be beaten, and I thought he deserved it. I was happy it happened. I didn’t try to kill him, but I would have been happy if he died. I will say that I do hope he was able to overcome his demons and go live a normal life somewhere. If he wasn’t able to do that, if he stayed the way he was, then I truly do hope someone out there killed him. When I knew him he was a rabid dog, and whichever way it went I just hope he isn’t still out there hurting anyone else.",Crazysonthrowoff,https://old.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/c93egn/i_stood_by_and_allowed_my_wife_to_almost_kill_our/

confessions,Why I am Aunt Susan the Karma Farming Facebook Fiend (self.confessions),"My Reddit username is Coolgirlonthetrain. I am not really “cool” but I commute daily on a train. So it’s partially correct. I am an English woman. Living in England. About 2 years ago the fate that is called life landed an American guy in my local pub. My first impression was that he was different and a little odd. I was drawn to this oddness. It was cool and exciting and it brings out my personality and inner quirks. About a year ago we have become the best of friends. It’s platonic and it’s amazing. It’s a friendship like no other. Well, of course being a typically reserved English woman I had never heard of Reddit. The guy, who shall be known as Mr X obviously is a hardcore Redditer and has an established account. He told me about Reddit suggesting I set up an account and bet that I could never achieve the same amount of Karma as him. I think it was more the smug grin on his face as he was looking down at me that had the greatest impact and made me more so determined. What I don’t think he realised is that I am incredibly competitive with the determination and heart of a Lion. The prize if I did would be a trip to Canada. I have never been West so for me this would be incredible. This was three weeks ago. Over the last three weeks I have frantically posted all sorts of stuff in an eager attempt to work out what works. I have been called every name under the sun “Karma Whore” “Karma Farmer” “Aunt Susan” and to colloquially go back to Facebook. I have even been requested to stay on my side of the “Pond”. This is my confession. This is why I have been behaving like Aunt Susan the Karma Farming Facebook fiend. I apologise and if you’re interested I will of course keep you posted.

confessions,I broke up with my boyfriend because he yelled at me. (self.confessions),"I'm a 29 year old woman. He and I dated for about eight months. Our relationship was fine. We did things together, we had fun. There weren't any obvious red flags, but I always got this feeling that he didn't value me much. At times he seemed a bit cold and acted like he was annoyed with me for no apparent reason. It all came to a head when, three days ago when we were hanging out at my place, he asked me to hand him the TV remote. I was sitting right next to him on the couch and was working on my laptop. I reached for the remote without looking and accidentally handed him my phone instead. I though it was funny after I realized what I had done. I laughed as I handed him the actual remote. He had that same annoyed look on his face. He began yelling at me and called me ""a stupid bitch"". I was stunned. I have NEVER raised my voice at him, or disrespected him in any way. I did not deserve to be treated this way. I told him our relationship was over and asked him to leave. He told me to calm down and stop overreacting. I simply walked to the front door opened it wide and told him to get out, and never come back. He walked out telling me I was being dramatic. The very next day I returned the presents he had given me. They meant nothing to me now. My friends are telling me that I DID overreact and I shouldn't just end a relationship because he yelled at me once, and have asked me to patch things up. His friends too began harassing me on social media. I blocked them all (HIS friends, not mine). I'm not going to reach out to him to try to ""work things out"" as some people have suggested. Because I know that I do not deserve this treatment. I've always treated him with respect and I deserve that in return. I just needed to tell somebody.

confessions,I used to pay my middle school bully not to bully me then I found out he actually needed the money (self.confessions),"He made my life a living hell. He would turn all the boys in class against me and bully me about my eyebrows. One time he begged me to buy him pizza and said he promises not to bully me all week if i do. So I bought him a box of pizza and he fulfilled his promise. I loved the idea. I began to do it on a regular basis. I started asking him every Friday what he wants next week so that the bullying doesn't happen again. He asked for 2 bags of hot fries (a potato chip flavor here in the US) and another time he wanted some milk from the cafeteria. And once he asked for colored pencils for art class. My school had a uniform dress code. It was $25 per shirt and the pants were $15, if I remember correctly. He showed up the first day of 8th grade in regular clothes, a tee and jeans. So he got sent to the main office to wait for his parents. My aunt was there because she used to drop off my lunch and hand me money to buy food after school. She saw him upset and asked what's wrong and he starts crying lightly. His parents wouldn't come because they couldn't afford the uniform and decided it would be best to avoid the situation. After my aunt hands me my lunch, she buys him a uniform hoodie, a couple of tees, and a long sleeve. He said he had pants at home and he was hesitant to accept but eventually took them and thanked her. Now (13 years later) he runs a nonprofit that has something to do with kids receiving books. I think it's sweet and I forgive him for being a bully because he didn't grow up to be an a-hole like most bullies. Edit: Thank you for all the nice comments!!

confessions,"Today, my next door pregnant neighbor knocked on my door. (self.confessions)","Around 7 pm today, I heard some knocking on my door. I opened it and it was my next door pregnant neighbor (she was, I think, in her 7th or 8th month). She was holding a small plate in her hand. In a very shy voice, she asked me if I can give her some of what ever I was cooking because she liked the smell. I think pregnant women sometimes have strong cravings and they can not resist it. Anyway, She was shy and apologized a lot for her request since we don’t know each other. I laughed and told her it is ok :). I was cooking a traditional meal from my country and the recipe has olive oil, garlic, jalapeños and some spices. I think the smell was nice. I gave her some of my dinner then she left.

confessions,"As a husband and father, I feel like I’m just an [un]glorified wallet and no one respects me or even acknowledges my contribution (self.confessions)","I’ve been married 8 years. I’m 30, my wife is 33. We have two kids; a boy (5) and a girl (3). I get up every week day at 4:00am. Clean up the litter box, walk the dog, sweep up the house (no vacuum because everyone is still sleeping). I fold the clothes that had dried overnight in the dryer. I check the children’s laundry baskets, and start new loads. I go for a three miles run in the dark at 5:00am. I’m showered and on the road by 6:00am. I commute for an hour and a half to a job I’m not particularly thrilled about but I’m good at it and I’m paid well. I’d rather be home building furniture and learning to be a chef. Officially I work from 8:00am to 5:00pm but we rarely finish at the office before 6:30pm. I drive home another hour and a half. When I get home the house is a mess. There’s no dinner. I’m starving. Did they eat? Yes they did. Uber Eats. Did they order anything for dad? Maybe, if I’m lucky. Wife will be on her phone. Daughter sometimes sleeping, sometimes not, son sometimes sleeping, sometimes not. I’d like to spend time with them, but I need to eat. Bowl of cereal or TV dinner, then. I check the laundry machine. Yep. Laundry from this morning is still there, and a huge pile that didn’t even get started is next to the machine. I put the first load into the dryer and start the next ones. Wife lectures me on how stressful and hard her day was. How hard can it be when I hired a day nanny. Oh she means stressful drama with her friends. Oh yes, tell me about what a bitch Brenda is and what a perfect mom she thinks she is and how she’s fake. My, that’s so interesting. Yes, a blowjob would be awesome. Oh wait you didn’t say blowjob, you said bill, as in the bill for all the just had to have things you ordered off amazon today. She tells me about how I never have time for any of them and how I’m an absentee father and I need to “step up” my contribution at home. Well, this weekend I have to mow the lawn and paint the garage and do all sorts of other chores you insist need to be done only by me, I’m sorry if there’s not two of me and I can’t go on play dates with you and go to champagne brunches where you all pat one another on the back and tell one another how brave and hard working you are to be sitting in a restaurant paying $50 for a plate of food at noon on a weekday for a three hour lunch and yoga afterward when your husband gets a Stouffer’s TV dinner that he heats himself. I’m sorry I can’t be like the J Crew family in the ad and be smiling all the time. Someone has to pay for the house you insisted on, the SUVs you insisted on, the Montessori school you insisted on, the fashionable clothes you insisted on, the organic this and that you insisted on, the hair salon and nail appointments you insisted on.

I really wish you wouldn’t condescend to me when you discuss me to your friends, as if I’m obsessed with my career and that’s why you’re stuck being supermom. You already know I’m happy with an apartment and used economy cars and buying our clothes at Target and working a job where I get to be home to see my kids. Why are you and the nanny so busy that your combined efforts can’t put the load of laundry in the dryer and press a button. Why do you leave dishes in the sink for me to do after I come home. If you want me to keep working my 160k a year job to to fun your lifestyle that’s fine, I’m your hubby and that’s what I signed up for. I’m your man and it’s my job to support you. I wish you would act like you’re on my side, though, realize that I want to be home, but if you want all the stuff you insist are non negotiable, someone’’s got to go out there and pay for them because that shit ain’t free. Thing is, all of it would be more okay if you just said thanks, Mike, I know you’re working hard or us and that you’re doing your part to keep this train rolling. Instead you paint this picture on social media like you’re busting your ass and I’m just off playing golf instead of stressing every second if I’m making enough money to support the lifestyle you want and feel entitled to. You paint me like I’m into myself when I want to be into all of us, be part of the bubble you’re keeping me out of. Why do you resent it so much when our son says he loves me and appreciates me and wants to spend time with me. Why do you hate it when our daughter wants to stay up and watch me eat and talk to me. I’m a husband and a father. I’m a workhorse. That’s life. I’ve told you how I feel but you tell me I’m crazy and being a crybaby. I don’t think asking you to order something for me if you’re going to spend money on dinner is unreasonable. If you really want to impress me, cook something for all of us. Marriage is a partnership. It feels like I’m doing more of the lifting than half. That’s okay. But I need you to not gaslight me and treat me like I do nothing while you do everything. That’s not cool. I’m not your dad but I feel like I’ve just taken custody of you and our kids and just get treated like crap. Please stop rolling y our eyes like it’s cringe when I try to play guitar and sing with our kids. They love it. You don’t have to but please don’t encourage them to laugh at me. This is not a contest. This is marriage. I do my part, you do your part. Your part shouldn’t be laughing at my part, thanks. Also, it’s hard to get a boner when you’re berating me. Be glad I can get it up at all when we make love. Thanks.",IwannaBeLikeMichah,https://old.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/r1juwk/as_a_husband_and_father_i_feel_like_im_just_an/
confessions,I fake an accent at my job (self.confessions),"My heart is pounding writing this because I literally haven’t told anyone this. So I work at this one store, and I work on the sales floor; but before all that, I was just one person interviewing for a position at the store. Before I arrived for my interview, a friend of mine dared me to interview in a British accent. I said I’d do it only if they paid me, and to my surprise, they sent me like $10 through venmo (which was more than enough for me). I went into the interview with the mindset that I wasn’t gonna get hired and they inevitably hired me on the spot. Accent and all. I was nervous because I had already talked to a whole bunch of higher ups with the accent and decided to just go through with it -thinking it was only going to be a summer job. I was so wrong. It’s been like 7 months that I’ve been working there and I still use the accent to this day. When people ask me where I’m from I just tell them my hometown because I have several brits from that town whom I grew up with. The accent hasn’t really posed a problem until now cause my bf is friends with one of my coworkers so I’m gonna have to find the right time to come clean.. thanks for coming to my TedTalk EDIT1: I know that several of you guys wanted to know how I talk, so heres the link to hear me speak as both: a fraud, and as myself! Enjoy roasting me :-) https://vocaroo.com/i/s0UFHVF7Ljtu UPDATE: finally told my boyfriend about the accent and he said, and I quote, “well babe, you just gotta fake it till you make it, and get the hell out of there!” I got a lucky one, y’all!

confessions,I photoshop every photo of my mom (self.confessions),"My mom has really had a hard time the past few years. When she entered menopause she gained weight and no matter how much she works out or what diet she tries she cannot drop it. She is a wonderful person, beautiful inside and out, but I could tell it was really taking a toll on her. So I started (lightly) photoshopping pictures I take of her before I send them to anyone or print them. I just nip a little here and there, slight reshaping. and smoothing out a few wrinkles, nothing drastic, but enough. Since I have started this she has started acting more confidently and has stopped making negative remarks about pictures she is in. She loves being in pictures with everyone again. It has really helped. I have not told anyone and never will.",wellsee2,https://old.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/a1osem/i_photoshop_every_photo_of_my_mom/
confessions,I hate my brain damaged sister.. (self.confessions),"I can't believe I am actually typing this out right now, it's making it feel very real. And before you say it, I know, I know. I am probably one of the worst human beings on this planet. Around a year ago, my older sister (27), widowed mother of 2 boys (8) and (5) decided to, against every single warning made, get drunk as shit and wreck her car into a rock embankment outside of our town. She was life flighted to a ICU, spent weeks in a coma and awoke in vegetative state. In the past year, she has SLOWLY began to see some progress. Because of this accident, I was forced to quit my job, leave my friends, move across the country and back in with my parents, to help take care of her and raise my nephews. I love them dearly, but I have never wanted to have kids, especially not forced upon me like this. She had the mind of a child now, argues about silly things, can't cook for herself, cries over everything, can't read, memory loss, partially paralyzed on her right side, has aphasia, and a LIST of other problems with me as her caregiver. She tell me how happy she is to be alive after such a bad car accident. I want to scream that I wish she would have died. Her boys are a wreck after losing their dad recently and now having a fucked up mom. My parents are spending all of their retirement savings for her treatments. I can see the years getting shaved off my dad and mom from the stress. I don't treat her any differently, I still tell her stories and laugh with her and do my best, but I hate the way I feel when I look at her. Did you even think about your boys when you got in your car? She is smiling and completely ignorant to the pain she has caused to my entire family. So I guess that's it. That's my confession. I have a deep dark hatred and resentment for someone I love. And I will never let her know. Edit: I am a female btw.. and some people have said pretty horrid and cruel things and I totally get it. But I already feel pretty fucking shitty about my feelings so you can't really make me feel any worse. Everyone else. Thank you so much for the support, advice and feedback. I've read and appreciated every comment. Alot of the medical and healthcare advice I will be talking to my parents about and hopefully the financial parts of this can be helped a bit. Thanks guys, much love.",,https://old.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/biii6y/i_hate_my_brain_damaged_sister/
confessions,My dad passed away this morning (self.confessions),"He was riding his motorcycle to work early this morning. At around 230am he crashed his bike, we're thinking he had a heart attack and that's what caused him to crash. In high school, about 13 years ago, I had to do a paper for English class. The topic was ""Write a paper on either a personal hero of yours, or something that influenced you growing up."" and then present it to the class. I wrote my paper on my dad. I wrote about how much I loved him, how much he cared for me, his 15 years in the Army, and how he was raising me to be a successful adult. I probably spent more time on that than any other paper I did. I was proud of it, and happy I got to read it aloud. Later that evening I mentioned the paper to my dad, told him we could do it on either a hero or something that influenced us. He asked what I did mine on. I was embarrassed so I told him I did it on a band. The last 13 years I've regretted that. The last 13 years I've wanted to tell him what I did the paper on. Just two days ago it came across my mind again. Dad. I wrote that paper on you. You're my hero, always were and always will be. I'm sorry I didn't tell you how much I loved you, and how much you meant to me. Thank you for always being there. I love you Dad. //edit// Wow. I did not expect this kind of response. Thank you everyone for your wishes and condolences. The stories you guys told down really hit close to home. Again, thank you. And if anyone needs to talk or anything send me a message : ) Update 3/26: No one is probably going to see this, so I'm really just doing this for me. Things have been real hard, as you can imagine. My mom has had it the worst. But at the same time I know things are getting better. My family isn't sobbing anymore, and my mom isn't hysterical. People still cry, but it isn't as prevalent anymore. We had a little private viewing on Thursday, it was awful. But needed I think. Yesterday was the visitation. I expected 30-40 people to show up, turns out roughly 250 people were there. It was insane. My dad apparently touched alot of lives and meant alot to alot of people. He was an engineer on the railroad the last 16 years and the railroad literally shut down all operations so the workers could come. Today is the funeral, starts in about three hours. Not really sure what to expect. I'll be speaking during the service and actually reading this story since I don't have a copy of this paper anymore. Update 4/14: Again, definently not expecting a single soul to see this. Maybe I'm just using this as a journal of sorts, I don't know. Anyway. The funeral was exactly like he would have wanted. He was a retired Soldier and was proud of his service so we had a military funeral. It began at the funeral home where somber family and friends filed in. The minister began everything and then called me up to say some things. First being something from my mom who wanted me to tell everyone what her family in Germany is doing in regards to the death. Then I told my story, the one from above. Then I finished off with the Fiddlers Green poem which is a poem about where deceased Cavalrymen go, which he was. I changed a few words around to make it more appropriate and left out the final verse. The funeral was about 40 minutes long and then the 38 car procession left to the nearby Army base where we held the military funeral. It was very nice. Minister said some words, taps, 21 gun salute, and the folded flag which my mom received. It's exactly what he would've wanted. A couple days after the funeral, my mom flew to Washington to stay with my brother and his wife. She's flying back tomorrow and then flying to Germany in a few weeks to see her family. While she's home I'll be living with her for however long she needs, as well as when she gets back from Germany. My family is doing better I think. My mom still had episodes, as do I. It's been a little harder this last week, not exactly sure why. I decided to go to the crash site where we erected a cross with his name, date of birth and death, and a sign with a poem. He worked at the railroad for 16 years and his coworkers were very affected as well. Someone stopped at the cross and put my dad's work vest around it, it was touching. I lost it right there on the off ramp from the interstate. No one has gone to see the tomb stone yet, we're waiting for my mom. Since it's on a military base the tombstones are all uniform but they let us personalize the words some. My mom let my brother and I picked the personalization. It will say, on three different lines, ""Proud Veteran"" ""Black Horse"" ""Scouts Out"". Black Horse being his favorite unit while he was in, and Scouts Out a sort of saying among Cavalrymen. Update 7/9: I've gotten a few messages lately asking about how I'm doing and such, it's unbelievable that a) so many people commented on this and (b) I'm still receiving messages like that four months later. Well. Things have gotten better. One of the comments here said something along the lines of ""One day he'll no longer be the 1st thing you think of in the morning, he'll be the 2nd, then the 3rd, then the 4th."" I guess that's where I'm at. I still think about him every day, but it isn't the first thing. I'm not sure what I said and didn't say previously and I don't want to read up, it would hurt too much. So if I repeat something, I'm sorry. We got the death certificate a while back, took longer than normal they said. His death was officially ruled accidental, but it also says his heart was probably a factor but it couldn't be proven. Apparently he didn't have but a couple bruises and some other injuries that wouldn't have been fatal. All of his motorcycle gear was on. My mom didn't tell me this initially, but sometime later. He left for work at 2am on his motorcycle. She said just a couple minutes later she heard a motorcycle stop in front of their house and their dogs perked up like he came home. She said she didn't hear him open his truck or anything. Just that a motorcycle stopped in front, and a minute or two later drove off. She thinks, and I do too, that he might not have been feeling well and turned around. That maybe he was coming home to have her take him to the hospital, then decided against it. If that was the case, I've been wondering if maybe he wasn't feeling well the last leg of the trip, he was only one or two minutes from his work. Just maybe he knew something was really wrong at the end and he tried making it to his work, he felt dizzy or something and knew he had to get there quickly for help. But then he just blacked out. We'll never know for sure, but I at least believe he came back and thought about going to the hospital. We've finally gotten a couple of the life insurance claims back so that makes my mom feel more secure financially. She was real, real scared she wouldn't get anything or not get enough to support her. But, my dad really set her up so she should be fine. One policy her purchased pays off 98% of their mortgage, it's crazy. We're expecting her to get around $600,000, and my dad's railroad pension kicked in last week, that was a real bad day for my mom. Every couple of weeks I'll have a real, real bad day so I'll stop at his cross on highway. I feel more attached to that than the military cross on base. Father's Day was terrible. I took my motorcycle there along with an ex-gf. Aside from that I guess I don't have much else to say anymore. My friends still ask about my mom and such but I'll usually try and change the subject if it gets too deep, still hurts too much to talk about. Anyway. I guess I'll update again later, probably not as long as the three months it took for this. Thanks for the continuing guys. Update 10/8: I'm still receiving messages and comments from a lot of Redditors asking how we're doing or that my story has gotten them thinking about their own loved ones. I did not expect any of this. At the time I wrote this I was a sobbing mess and just wanted to vent to myself and figured writing my feelings down would help. But here we are six months later and there are still alot of reactions coming my way. So I figured I'd do another update. But first, I want to apologize to everyone that messaged or commented and I never replied to. I responded to as many as I could but it got to be too much, so I'm sorry. Well, update. Since July, my mom managed to complete all of the life insurance paperwork with the help of an attorney. The attorney found an additional policy that we did not know about, a policy worth $500,000. So my mother ended up receiving close to $1,000,000 from all of the policies and there was another that required the bank to pay off 97% of their house. My dad wanted her to live her life exactly however she wants. He wanted her to go shopping, take trips to Germany to see her family, and never have to worry about money ever again. None of us had any idea he had so many policies, let alone what was in them. My mom is taken care of for life. The attorney she hired went with her to see a financial advisor at Edward Jones. He came up with safe, slow growth investments and put some money into CDs that will ensure her money will last for several years to come. My mother even purchased a new house last week (in cash lol), the house of her dreams. It isn't big, but it has privacy and it's wooden on the outside which is something she said she always wanted. As far as my brother and I..I'm doing better. Someone on here told me a while back, ""Right now he's the first thing you think of. Eventually he'll be the second, then the third, fourth, etc."" Whoever said that was absolutely correct. I still think about him everyday, mostly at night or when I'm working on someone's furnace in the basement because I'm usually alone with my thoughts (I'm in HVAC). I have several great friends that are always there for me, and a special friend that will sleep over with me on bad nights. I've been in contact with the VA about trying to see a therapist, but the paperwork to see one that isn't VA affiliated is long and arduous. My brother's wife recently found out she's pregnant. It's fantastic news obviously, but solemn as well because they'll never meet each other. I have a five year old and it worries me he won't remember his grandfather. My dad absolutely loved my son and spent alot of time with him. I'm sorry if this is rambling. It's 11pm and I'm on-call so I'm pretty exhausted. I'll for sure update again. It helps typing these things out and helps much more knowing it's helping others. Thank you all for taking the time to read my story and all of its updates. Update 12/1: My mom moved out of their house two weeks ago and it's up for sale. There's already one interested buyer and an open house tomorrow. I drove by the old house and saw the for sale sign, I got pretty emotional over that. It was strange. So many memories there. Obviously family memories, but all of my high school memories and well. Alot of memories with my best friends and various girlfriends as well. It's just..strange. Her new house is very nice. It's one of those that look small on the outside but the inside is real big. The previous owner was a carpenter by trade so he created alot of custom wood work throughout the place. It's very, very nice. Side note my mom fell on ice a few days ago and cracked her knee cap. She was supposed to go to Germany with my brother and sister in law in there weeks but the doctor had said she might not be able to fly. Not really sure why not, but that's what he said. That's all I can think of right now. I'll update again later. Update 1/5/19: It's strange to think about my dad being gone. That one day he's here in my apartment, and 10 hours later he's gone. Like, I'll never see him again. Talk to him again, hear his voice. He's ashes in an urn underground now. I just want to see him one more time. Hear him. Tell him I miss him. He's physically gone. Forever. I mean. I saw him. Then 10 hours later he's gone. And no one saw it coming. I keep wondering what his last minutes were like. My mom heard his motorcycle pull up a few minutes after he left for work and then leave after a minute. Maybe he wasn't feeling well and thought about going to the hospital? I wonder if he wasn't feeling well the whole way to work. When did he realize something was seriously wrong? How fast was he going so he could make it to work to get help? He was only one or two minutes away. Was he panicking? What was he thinking? I keep imagining that's what happened. That he was getting close to work and suddenly he started feeling like something wasn't right so he drove as fast as he could to get help but didn't make it. Did he know he wouldn't make it? What were his last thoughts? Was he only thinking about getting help, or was he thinking about his family? 2018 was awful. I lost several big parts of my life. My girlfriend moved out the same exact night he passed away. I spent most of 2018 depressed. Literally. The majority of 2018 I was sad more than any other emotion. When I was happy it didn't seem to last very long. I have an appointment with a therapist next week. I'm nervous. But so many things happened in 2018 and I don't know who else to talk to except that ex that moved out. She's still my best friend and I tell her everything, but I am still in love with her so I cannot talk to her about her. I'm just sad, and depressed.

confessions,I found a friends Reddit account and its sad. (self.confessions),"We aren't like best friends but we know each other pretty well. Today I noticed a pic. from my city someone posted, So I clicked on their user name and started snooping, wondering if I could figure out if I knew them and Holy Moly I sure do. How you may ask, well he...yes he, he post a lot of picture on another sub of his dog and newish adopted cat (didn't know he had a cat but this will be important soon). I started reading his comments/posts and I feel so bad for him. First of all the love of his life past a few years ago, and he came upon a little dog and he fell in love with this at the most 6lbs Chihuahua (named baby), Picture a 56year old, 6 foot 4inch biker dude with a beard that hangs down to his chest that carries a small Chihuahua in his jacket pocket or in the summer the dog goes in a fanny pack and rides with the dog on his motorcycle. Its the most adorable thing I have ever seen. Why is this sad, well like I said, I didn't know he had a cat. After reading his post its clear he has kept the info about the cat a secret, cause people made fun of him with such a small dog for his size. he told me one time about how much baby had help him after his wife past, he talked, he cried and hugged baby and if it wasn't for this little doggy he would've/and planned to kill himself. He said he planned to ride to Colorado and drive off a mountain. In the post of pic's he found this kitten wet, cold and starving. Took the cat to the vet for all its shots and he talks so passionately about his new love. I'm thinking about sending him a message on the pretense of just checking up on him since its been before Thanksgiving since I spoke to him. hoping he will say something about the cat, so I can reassure him he has nothing to hide. but I'm not sure how to really approach this subject or just leave it alone. This man has a heart of gold who helps anyone no matter what he's doing he'll stop just to listen or give a helping hand. now before anyone asked about how do I know for sure its him. I know his house and yard, in the pic's I noticed items that are in his house, his back patio with the same furniture and a smoker (that he built, it's a one of a kind) plus a ring that he always wears. I""m not even sure if I have posted this on the right sub, if this is the wrong sub. sorry please forgive me. EDIT: Thanks everyone, I did text him, Just with HI how have you been? we need to hang out some time for a couple of beers. And guess what!! he told me about the black kitten he found in Kansas on a work trip. He so proud of that little thing. He named her Momma, cause she gives him the same side look his wife would give him and that was what his nickname was for his wife.LOL. We are meeting up this weekend at our old beer joint in town. I'm happy for him, he seems like he's in a good place now.",shell1212,https://old.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/akv7d5/i_found_a_friends_reddit_account_and_its_sad/
confessions,I'm dying but haven't told anyone (self.confessions),"I was diagnosed with cancer a little over two weeks ago, after a regular checkup. Turns out I have a tumour on my colon that has spread to other areas (liver and lungs so far) and will require extensive chemo and surgery for any chance to live longer than 8 months I'm not having any treatment and I haven't told my wife because she'll only pressure me to get the treatment, which result in months of pain and suffering for a relatively small chance Instead, I'm making sure our last few months together are filled with only happy memories. I'm starting work later and finishing earlier each day, to make her breakfast in bed and take her on dates in the evenings My landlord I rent my workshop from has agreed to let me run my business rent free for the next 6 months, which means significantly less financial stress and I can save a lot more, so she has something to carry her over afterwards I hope she'll forgive me for taking this path",Thrownaway54332,https://old.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/9omu5y/im_dying_but_havent_told_anyone/
confessions,I found out my high school bully is dead and I'm ecstatic (self.confessions),"Couple days ago I found out that the guy who bullied me all throughout high school died, and honestly i couldn't be happier. My friends all tell me I'm terrible for being happy, but they have no idea what I went through because of him. He almost drove me to suicide and knowing he's dead just makes me feel better. I feel bad for his parents and I'd never wish that upon anyone to outlive their children, but I just can't help myself. Edit: Since it's coming up a lot i just want to clarify. I never wished death upon him, I know he was a terrible person and did terrible things, but I never wished the guy was dead. Edit 2: For those asking or wondering how he died, I dont know. I assume it was drugs or alcohol because the obituaries never stated anything nor was it explained on social media. I also made the assumption off of what his personality was like. Edit 3: After thinking about it all day, and reading through the comments I came to realize that 'ecstatic' wasnt the correct word. It's more relieved and indifferent. I dont know what his home life was like or what made him into the bully that he was, all I know is that all he did was bully me and make my life miserable. Could he have been different? Maybe. Could he have changed his ways since then? Maybe. It doesn't change what he did. Life happens, people live and people die. There's nothing we can do about it. Hindsight is 20/20, if I could go back and tell myself to stand up and not take it I would, but I cant. There are a lot of things I wouldve done differently regarding it, but it's done, it's in the past. Nothing can change it.",ZodiacDestroyer,https://old.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/a2457z/i_found_out_my_high_school_bully_is_dead_and_im/
confessions,I’ve realized I detest my boyfriend (self.confessions),"We’ve been together almost three years. We live together. I support us 100%. In the time we’ve been together, he’s worked maybe two months. He’s depressed and anxious and he steals all the oxygen and joy out of every room. He never wants to go anywhere but then complains that we never go anywhere. I got him an interview at my work - a moderately well paid entry level position. He refused to go, saying he wasn’t ready. Then spends time complaining about not having a job. You get the idea. Everything in our lives revolves around him and his moods. He cries, yells or just sighs incessantly. There’s no laughter or happiness in our home. I walk on eggshells all the time. I dread coming home from work. He grabbed me a few days ago and shook me so hard I’m bruised on my upper arms. The apartment is in my name, but he literally has no where to go because he has no friends and he refuses to contact his family. So he’d be homeless and I can’t do that to him (or any human really). I fantasize about being alone all the time. Like only cooking or shopping or doing anything just for myself. It would be incredible. To be able to breathe again. His birthday was last week and I saved up for a month to get him something related to his hobby. When I gave it to him, he said “i just told you I didn’t want to do this anymore. What were you thinking?” I think at that point any love I still felt for him just died. He doesn’t cook, clean, care for his dog or do anything but play video games. I’m trapped in a prison and I just don’t really care what happens to me anymore. I don’t want to die, but I wouldn’t be upset if I didn’t wake up tomorrow, if that makes sense. I know what i should do but I’m just a dumb bitch. Thanks for reading. Typing it out helps. Edit: welp this reached the front page and now I’m super uncomfortable with everything so I’m not going to be posting anymore. I appreciate all the advice - the tough love too. Hopefully I’ll be back with a happy update in the future. Thanks for everything, Reddit.",hermoinejean,https://old.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/q08ck2/ive_realized_i_detest_my_boyfriend/

confessions,My brother went from killing animals to being a kindergarten graduate. (self.confessions),"My brother is 6 years old. I am 28. To make things as simple as possible, my parents suck. Like, they really, really suck. Last January, I had just started my last semester of nursing school. One day I was walking out to my truck to go to class, and DSS is in the driveway. They tell me that my brother is going into foster care tomorrow and I’m the only option left, so they wanted to ask me before they proceeded. I didn’t even know my brother had been taken or anything that had been going on. Again, my parents suck and I had blocked them and shut off all contact for a while. Apparently, 2 months prior, my brother’s mom had another baby that was born in withdrawal from meth, benzos, and suboxone. My dad also failed for meth and benzos. Unfortunately, the baby died. My brother was also removed that day. He had went to another family member initially, but she could not handle him and there was no other family members that could pass a drug test. Except me. I decided to take him. They warned me. He’s violent, his behaviors are horrible, he has killed animals. I took him any way. I hadn’t saw my brother much in the last couple of years, but I decided to give it a shot. It was a night mare. He was 5 and had been expelled from kindergarten twice. I tried to enroll him in kindergarten at a different school, but he couldn’t function a day without hitting, cussing, destroying class rooms, throwing stuff. One day, his kindergarten teacher had to evacuate the classroom because he was destroying it. I had to put him in a school for “children who can’t function in public school”. He went there for 9 months. He hit me. Kicked me. Spit on me. Screamed at me. Actively defied me and laughed about it. I had to repotty train him. He had been having accidents prior to coming to me. I filed an investigation for sexual assault, which I 100% know he was, but “no evidence, blah blah”. I started him in therapy. He has ODD, ADHD, RAD, and PTSD. I had to leave class every day to pick him up. I was scared I was going to fail, but somehow I didn’t. I got a job in the emergency department, and had to leave a lot to pick him up. Scared I was going to get fired. But didn’t. I tried everything. I cried and prayed more than I ever have. I read 100 different parenting books. I went to therapy for myself because it was so much and I felt like my 2 children weren’t getting any of the attention they deserved because what little I had to pour I poured into him. I started going to therapy with him weekly. One day I went to the court house to relinquish my custodial rights. I just couldn’t take it anymore. 2 days later I took it back and kept telling myself “don’t give up. Be who you needed”. My brother hasn’t had any accidents in a year. He hasn’t harmed any animals. He had to repeat kindergarten, but he has repeated it in public school and I haven’t had to pick him up in over 6 months. He can now count to 100 when before he couldn’t even recognize the numbers between 1 and 10. He can read when before he couldn’t even recognize any letters of the alphabet. He says please and thank you and listens when he is told to do something or to stop doing something. He doesn’t kick or hit or bite or scream. And just last week he walked across the stage as a kindergarten graduate. A day I often wondered would even be possible. I believe my brother, my son, is going to grow up and do very big things. I’m glad I didn’t give up. I’m glad I could be who I needed.",Acceptable_Brick816,https://old.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/13uirt2/my_brother_went_from_killing_animals_to_being_a/
confessions,"When I was 16 I took my family pet to the vet, found out he was terminally ill and never told anyone. (self.confessions)","I’m the eldest of 4 kids in a family of six and growing up we had a beautiful albino chinchilla named Dusty. Dusty was an awesome little pet to have as a kid. Very sweet, never bit anyone, loved to cuddle and run around “digging” tunnels in the bedsheets. He had this really big cage in our guest bedroom that was connected to my room and every time someone would walk past his cage, he would run to the gate hoping to be taken out. If you opened the gate he would just hop right into your hand.. anyway great pet. So about 3 days after I got my drivers license as a 16 year old, I noticed that one of Dusty’s eyes were tearing a little bit which I hadn’t seen happen before. Feeling like a brand new adult with my new drivers license, I decided to take it upon myself to bring him to the vet and see what was up. So, I put him into a brown paper grocery bag with his favorite blanket, made some air holes, stapled it shut, and strapped him into the passenger seat of my family’s van. Fast forward maybe a half hour and I’m sitting in the vets office holding Dusty feeling like the most responsible adult ever. The vet is an exotic animals vet and takes a look at him then asks to do an X-ray. So she sedates him a little, does the X-ray, hands him back to me and leaves the room. Adult level 9000 as I sit petting him until he wakes back up. So vet comes back in and sits next to me on the little bench in the checkup room and starts petting him in my lap. She’s telling me how wonderful he is and how lucky I am to have such a great little pet, asking me my favorite memories of him, all this. So we are talking and finally I ask her something like okay so how much do chinchilla eye drops cost because I’ve got to get going and she smiles gently saying something like I wish eyedrops could fix this. She gives me a hug and starts to explain. Dusty was not bread responsibly and had some kind of internal deformity involving the roots of his teeth putting pressure on his eyes and brain. This would eventually cause an early death. I couldn’t believe it. I remember starting to cry and putting Dusty back in his grocery bag with his blanket and asking if the vet had a stapler I could use to close it again. I paid cash to the receptionist from my babysitting money and got into my car crying all the way home. When I got home I sat in the car for awhile in the garage trying to gather myself as Dusty chewed on his bag. Looking back I’m not really sure why, but in the car I decided not to tell my family the news. The vet said Dusty wasn’t in pain despite his tearing eye and we wouldn’t have to put him down. She didn’t know how long exactly he had left, but guessed maybe a year. I guess I figured I didn’t want my family to be sad every time they played with him or passed by his cage knowing his time was limited. I wanted the rest of his little life to be normal. Eventually I brought him back in the house and put him in his cage. I went later that day to Petco and bought rodent eye drops as a coverup and “proudly” told my family that night how I brought Dusty to the vet to check his eye and lied saying the doctor gave me eyedrops and told me eye irritation is common in chinchillas. Dusty lived 3 more years after that, 2 years longer than the vet had expected. He passed away just shy of his 10th birthday. On the morning he passed I told my dad what had actually happened at the vet. He told me I was so much more of an adult than I knew. ~ [Edit: Thank you all for all the support, stories, and kind words. I never thought this post would get so popular. I’m sorry for making many of you cry (sometimes in non ideal places), but my heart is so warm knowing my experience touched so many people 🌷 you all are wonderful]",,https://old.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/b0ganm/when_i_was_16_i_took_my_family_pet_to_the_vet/
confessions,"My ex-wife committed suicide on Monday and I still haven't told my kids, but will on Saturday (self.confessions)","My ex and I divorced six years ago. It was an ugly divorce. Our sons are now 9 and 13. We live two miles a part and we get the kids one week on, one week off. After the divorce, we had no real meaningful relationship other than talking about the kids, scheduling and stuff. I had no idea or interest in her personal life and she was the same with me. This last year, she started acting strange. She started being more chatty and friendly with me. I wasn't interested in having a social relationship with her. On Monday, I picked the kids up from school for my week with them and she texted me around 8PM saying how I was the only person who she trusted 100% with the kids and I was a great dad and she thanked me for it. Then she told me to tell the boys that she loved them. That was weird because she would call my eldest to say goodnight every night that they were with me, but didn't on that night. I drive by her place on my way to work and noticed her car was still parked on the street, but assumed she was working from home or sick. I had texted her in the morning about picking up my son's school book that he left at her house and hours had past with no reply. That was very strange because she would reply within minutes if it had something to do with the kids. I started to grow a bit worried and called her. Again, I know nothing about her social life so it wasn't like I could call her friends because I don't know any of them and her parents live out of state. I left a vm telling her that if she didn't call or text me back by 2PM then I was going to her house to make sure she was okay. I left work early and went to her house. There were packages at her door which was another red flag. She would never leave packages unattended outside. I called, texted and knocked at the door and there was no response. I let myself in and called out for her. I went into her bedroom and saw this body with a large blood stain on her shirt and something that looked like a phone in her hand. That wasn't a phone. It was a gun and she had shot herself in the heart. Called the cops and they questioned me for three hours and told me they would reach out to her parents as I was no longer next of kin. I had to pick up my kids and kept a stone face as I was still processing the situation. On Wednesday, my eldest started complaining that his mom was not replying to his text messages and demanded that I take him to her house (which is still all taped up). He thinks she's ignoring his texts or that her phone is broken and wants to tell her to fix it. I asked to speak with his principal in private and told him that he would be missing school next week. He asked what in the world could be so important that he should miss a week of school. I told him his mom just committed suicide the other day and I haven't told him yet. Her mom has been calling me constantly asking to speak to the boys, but I told her I haven't told them yet because things have been moving too quickly. My eldest is picking up that something has happened and now the 9 year old is picking up vibes too. My 13 year old is demanding that we go to his mom's and even threaten to ditch school if I didn't do it. The 9 year old wouldn't let me drop him off at school and had a meltdown. I decided to tell them what happened Saturday because I am not prepared to deal with the madness coming my way. My 13yo will lose his shit.",InevitableHour,https://old.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/bjwatc/my_exwife_committed_suicide_on_monday_and_i_still/
confessions,"She lifted her hand, I winced (self.confessions)","Flashback, to about three years ago, I was in a relationship with this girl who I loved so much. I would've done everything I could for her, and I always did. I did my best to keep her happy, but she was going through her own personal battles. She lost her dad before we started dating, and her mom died of cancer while we were dating. She faced a lot, and I tried to comfort her. I think that maybe i started doing too much, because eventually my parents started getting stricter on me, and I used to disobey them to try to make her happy. Fast forward a few months, and there was this one time where she got mad because I didn't tell her I was preparing a surprise gift for her. She got mad, tore up the gift and broke everything in it that could have been broken. My eyes got watery at how she treated something I worked hard for. She told me to ""stop being a little b-tch"" and punched me in the face. This caught me off-guard as she had never done this before. But this was just the start. Every day or two, she would proceed to punch me in the face or anywhere else twice or three times a day. And I would just take it. I never argued about it, and I never mentioned it to anyone. There were several times that I seemed bruised, but I would just say that I got it while training (I had started getting into working out). She had gone from being extremely emotionally abusive, to physically and I didn't know how to handle it. I wanted to leave, but I was scared to as she had always wanted to kill herself, and I never wanted that to happen. I stayed for 2 years, until she went abroad to study. This is when i finally got to see how it felt to live without the constant fear of pain. Now back to the present day. I met this wonderful and perfect girl who has made me beyond happy. One day she was turning really quickly to ask me a question, with her hand up. I instantly jumped away to that and she looked at me confused. My eyes instantly got watery, and she began asking what had happened. I opened up to her for the first time about it, and I feel relieved. I just feel terrible knowing that this is how I might react to sudden movements for a long time. TL;DR: Ex-girlfriend was emotionally and physically abusive. New girlfriend moved suddenly, and i jumped away and teared up. Opened up about my past.",,https://old.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/b667wu/she_lifted_her_hand_i_winced/
confessions,I was kidnapped when I was 8 and held in captivity for 3 years (self.confessions),"26f. I was picked up by a stranger from school posing to be my dad's friend. Saying that he would drop me off to the airport to catch a flight with my dad. Not only did I actually have to travel with my dad that day, but this man somehow knew my dad was getting off early from work (he told me that morning) and that he had to go fishing with his friend (he did this a lot). He told me that my dad sent him to pick me up and meet him directly at the airport. I believed him, convinced my teachers I knew him (because I was excited to go the airport) and left with him. I was held in captivity for 3 years. I was raped, beaten, starved. 11 year old me had learnt to make him trust me. It started with us going around in his car, although I had to sit in the backseat and stay quiet the whole time. He let me come into his kitchen and make food for myself, he let me clean his house. The day we went to feed the ducks at the park I ran. I ran as fast as my weak legs could carry me, because of the crowd; I think he lost me. I begged a family for help, telling them I was kidnapped and I wanted to go home. I told them my name, my school's name and my parents' names. Long story short; they caught him, he killed himself. I was back with my dad, my sisters, my dogs. I'm now happily married to my wife of 4 years, still undergoing therapy, have a good job, and a baby on the way. EDIT: I'm very sorry for the last line. I realise it doesn't end well for most and I got lucky. But the only way I kept going was telling myself ""I'm going to escape"", and then ""I'm going to get better"" ""I'm going to love myself again"" ""I'm going to get past my trauma"". Since this worked for me I assumed saying ""it will end well"" would work for other people too, of course it wasn't right though.",magnetlink5824,https://old.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/ltp3uv/i_was_kidnapped_when_i_was_8_and_held_in/

confessions,I poked a hole in a condom and purposefully got a girl pregnant to prove I wasn't gay (self.confessions),This was the late 80s and I was 14/15 and things weren't a great time to be a gay teenager not that it excuses what I did. I was so afraid of being outed that I started a relationship with my then bestfriend's sister. My friends were constantly messing with me about not having slept with her and calling me gay. They were just joking but I took it so seriously that I convinced her sex and I poked a hole in the condom hoping to get her pregnant so that I'd have proof... She did end up pregnant and when I found out the reality of what I did really hit me.. She just thought the condom didn't work and I never told her I did it on purpose... She was forced to go to an alternative school and eventually dropped out to have the baby. Her and her family moved away with the baby and I never kept in contact with them...

confessions,When I get spam calls I tell them this is my work phone and to call me on my personal phone. I give them the phone number of an old friend who screwed me over big time. (self.confessions),"As the title says, I get scam / spam calls all the time. I am very polite and say that I'm sorry but this is my work phone and I'm interested in talking with them but I can only talk on my personal phone. The guys phone number who I give seriously screwed me a couple years back after being life long best friends. Fuck that guy. Welcome to spam call hell. Edit: Okay. Explanation time. So I’ve known this dude my whole life. We were best friends for 16 years. For probably the past 5ish years before we parted ways we dreamed of running a business together. He moves to another part of the state about 5 hours away. And one night he calls me up and says he found a business for us to run together. The time had come. He’s found what seems like a perfect opportunity. So I pack up my bags, get my now wife (then girlfriend) on board and move to an area where we know no one and I have no job opportunities. But it was my dream so why not! Literally sign a lease. Moved my stuff in to a house we’re sharing. The day after I move in he tells me he’s been working on another business and it’s taking off and tells me without warning he’s not doing business with me. It really hurt me. But he was my best friend. So I moved on and tried to make a life for myself in this strange place. Over the next couple years he starts hanging out with a new crowd, doing drugs (weed and cocaine), and starts saying pretty rude things to me about how I’ve done nothing with my life and I’m becoming a real loser. I’m infuriated. But I didn’t let him know that. Fast forward a few months. I set up a hard to plan weekend with all my closest friends to come to our house and at the end I was to propose to my now wife. Well the night of the big engagement she said YES! I’m over the moon! What does he do? Invites all these new friends over and they crash the party, do drugs in the bathroom, eat the food that I made from scratch for the night and only had enough for my friends. Then 20 minutes after all the food is gone and I have a new fiancé, he decides that they’re gonna go to a bar and ditches me with the mess and lack of food. I didn’t tell him I was furious. Instead I pretended everything was okay, letting him think he’d be my best man in the wedding. Then once our shared lease was up, I moved out into a new place with my fiancé. Again, I let him think he was still in the wedding. I sent out invites and he doesn’t get his (hmm wonder why?) and I say it should be in the mail. But as the wedding gets closer I talk to him less and less. Finally I just cut him off cold turkey. No explanation. Complete and total radio silence. I did this because I wanted him to go the rest of his life wondering what happened and why I abandoned him. He didn’t deserve closure. But, I’m still mad. Thus why I do this relatively harmless piece of revenge. Fuck him. Clarification: There was plenty of other stuff he did that I called him out on. But I always got those apologies that go “yea that’s my bad, but you did this so I’m not in the wrong. So you’re bad”",ShortsBySteven,https://old.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/b6mfx9/when_i_get_spam_calls_i_tell_them_this_is_my_work/

confessions,I’ve lied to everyone in my life for 20 years that I’m Jewish... (self.confessions),"I’m not jewish, not even a little bit. If you asked me any questions about judaism, I couldn’t tell you, but still, everyone thinks I’m jewish. It all started in high school, 11th grade. I had just moved from California to The South and it was a rough time. I was called every horrible name in the book because I talked different and got the shit beat out of me multiple times. Well I slowly befriended some of the guys on the football team and my closest friend was the center, we’ll call him Greg. Now Greg is a super chill guy compared to everyone around him, but he’s still very very racist and very open about all his opinions. Well one day I’m driving Greg and a few other football players home from school and he makes a comment about synagogues. Without even thinking, I mention that I’ve been to one... and this is where it all started. This prompted one of the other guys to joke that I was a Jew, and trying to be chill (since these were the only friends I had) I went “haha, yep, I’m jewish.” And then that’s when it all went down hill. Greg told everyone on the football team how his new friend from California was a Jew, and they all believed it since most of them thought there were only Jews in California anyways. And the football players spread that to the rest of the school. At this point, I still thought it was a joke and everyone was just jokingly calling me jewish, so I just kept going with it. Then I became known as “The Jewish kid” and started to actually become popular, since everyone wanted to be friends with the different kid, (and the fact my dad had money, a lot compared to the poor area I went to school, so I could afford to buy nice things and people tend to be attracted towards that). And so being Jewish almost became my identity, it became who I was. So whenever someone would ask my religion, I just automatically told them I was jewish. Fast forwards to the end of high school, and the councilors are walking people through scholarship stuff, and my councilor calls me into his office and hand me a slip for a $5,000 Jewish American scholarship. Now as soon as I read jewish American scholarship, I was going to walk out and throw it out, but he made me sit down and fill it out with him, and then took it from me to submit it. I felt horrible for even doing it, but somewhat relieved when I heard that they only gave it to people who were also ethnically jewish, so I knew I wouldn’t get it. I got it. I received a letter in the mail saying I was chosen as the winner of this $5000 scholarship, I got accepted to Dartmouth due to the fact I worked my ass off in high school and was the valedictorian, though my competition wasn’t plentiful to say the least. But I never thought I would have been able to afford it, but this scholarship was huge in helping me towards that. I considered spilling everything then, declining the scholarship, telling everyone at school, telling almost every single form I’ve filled out, saying I’m not actually jewish... I decided to tell my dad and ask him for advice as he’s always been a guy you can talk to about anything whatsoever. So I tell him everything, I tell him about the joke, then the lie, then everything, and now the scholarship (which I hadn’t told any of my family about because 1. I never thought I’d get it, and 2. They’d question why a very not jewish person is getting a jewish American scholarship) and as soon as I told my father, he looked me dead in the eyes with the most serious, disappointed face.... and then burst into tears laughing. The way he reacted, it must’ve been the funniest thing he’d ever heard in his life. He told me he had gotten a letter in the mail asking if I was ethnically jewish for a scholarship I had entered, and being the person he is, he just say the chance for college money and went “yep, jewish” and that was apparently all they need. So my dad convinced me to keep the money and go to my dream college, and I did. As soon as I arrived at university, I was met with some people from the group that gave me this scholarship, some jewish American organization funded by wealthy Israelis, and they told me/enlisted me into all these jewish clubs and they got me set up in a synagogue, and I everyone there (I’d later learn 2 of the people there would be my professors, who were very jewish) and finally they told me they’d set me up with the whole “birthright” thing, where they fly American Jews out to Israel. I was so shocked, I was at my dream school, plus I was being hit with all of this, it was too much. I thought about coming clean a lot of times. But I feel like all the people around me would suddenly feel betrayed and leave me. I became good friends with a lot of people in these jewish clubs, I bonded with my teachers a lot better since they believed I was jewish, I met the most beautiful jewish girl (who I met through her mother, when she came up to me in a cafe, asked if I was jewish, since I was with the local Rabbi, I said yes, and she told me that I’d love her daughter. We went on a date and instantly hit it off) and I got a free trip to Israel. All the while, I was dealing with severe depression since I felt horrible every second of every day, in addition to the already enormous amounts of stress university puts on you. I came so close, so many times to just throw myself off a bridge or tall building, but I could never bring myself to do it. I managed to get all the way through 11 years of college to get my doctorate, got a job at a history museum back on the west coast, married that jewish girl, had a Jewish wedding with her entire family, and my two parents (my dad had spilled the beans to my mom about two days after I told him, she also found it equally as funny) we’ve had 3 little jewish babies, the museum put me in charge of organizing and creating a huge Holocaust/Jewish American history exhibit (even though that’s not my specific field even in the slightest.) And in a few months, when the current Curator retires at the age of 96, I will hopefully be taking his place. (He’s been training me for the job, I’ve worked there the longest, and I’ve made sure that I’m damn good at my job) My life has turned out great but deep down it will always haunt me that my entire life, is built on a lie. My kids lives, my life, my wife’s life, all came from a joke in a car 20 years ago... I was never going to tell a soul this, but today my oldest son (he’s 9) told me that he doesn’t think he believes in god, and I told him I agreed. It was the first time in 20 years that I told the truth about my religion, and didn’t lie. My son wants to tell his mom that he doesn’t want to continue being Jewish and I might use this as my way of getting out as well... I told him we’d tell her tomorrow at dinner and he seems almost as excited as I am, but equally as nervous. Wish us luck, I guess... I still am unsure if I should tell her the whole truth, or if I should just leave it with that I no longer want to be jewish. TL;DR: A friend from 20 years ago made a joke about me being a Jew since I moved there from California. This turned into everyone in my life thinking I’m jewish, causing me to meet a jewish girl, get a free trip to Israel, getting to go to my dream school, everything, but it’s all built on a lie and I feel horrible about it every single day. Telling my wife tomorrow that I’m not jewish, but am still unsure if I should tell her everything. EDIT: Just for clarification, because people have been questioning my use of the word “university” in place for “college”. Yes I know they’re not the same thing, I’ve just been surrounded by British people lately and they all use “university” so I’ve been saying that instead of college. It’s a recently adopted habit and I can assure you I’m American. Born in Folsom California, moving to Orange County and then to Santa Clarita, California where I lived for most of my younger life until my family moved to Americus, Georgia. I can assure you I’m definitely American. And as for my wife not finding out from my side of the family, it’s mainly due to the fact that we don’t talk to my side of the family for personal reasons and I haven’t talked to them in years, and she’s only ever met them once at the wedding, but she also wants nothing to do with them. I’ve decided I’m just going to tell her I’m not jewish. I won’t tell her I’ve lied about being Jewish for all these years, but I’m just going to tell her that I’m not jewish. Someone also said that since bother sides of my family are Czech, there’s a good chance I’m Jewish, so I’m thinking of doing a DNA test soon. Also when I said, “I know nothing about Judaism” that was an extreme exaggeration. I’ve obviously picked up a lot of knowledge over the years and I think my wife may have an idea due to the fact, whenever a Jewish holiday is coming up, she’ll remind me about it and tell me when it is/ what it’s for if I don’t already know. I’ll update later tonight on how it goes! EDIT 2: So I talked to her and I decided to just tell her everything.... and it didn’t go like I expected. She told me she had a feeling I wasn’t jewish from the beginning but never married me just because I was jewish, but married me for me, regardless of my faith. She said that she was sorry that I felt like I had to hide this from her for so many years and that I don’t have to pretend to be jewish if I don’t want to, but like a lot of people have commented, I do feel sort of culturally jewish now. I definitely identify more as a member of the Jewish community than I do any others. We’re not going to pressure any of our kids into Judaism and we’re going to let them decide what they want to do for themselves... and my wife and I agreed that it’d be for the best if we gave back since all the opportunities afforded to me came from the Jewish community, we’re going to get involved with an organization and we’re donating to 3 different scholarships for $5,000 each, and try and help fund birthright trips whenever we can.

confessions,I pavlov'd my girlfriend (self.confessions),"My ex used to use a specific shampoo and over time i noticed that every time i smell this shampoo on other people i automatically think of her and this got me planning.. For my current girlfriend, every time we got down to business i put on a cologne that i saved specifically for those times. No matter how spontaneous the action was, i found the time to put on a puff or two of this perfume secretly and then continue. After weve been going on for couple months, i began to do tests - i put this perfume on when casually walking in the kitchen past her, and just sat down in the living room. Soon enough, after couple minutes she got here and initiated sexy times! Now i use it ocassionally (im very careful not to overuse it so it doesnt spoil the effect) when i want to get hee going, and it works well enough :) My favorite is putting it on before going out to a public place, and watching her get super worked up and unload at home",ThrowawayABCJ_,https://old.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/b31odu/i_pavlovd_my_girlfriend/
confessions,My stepdad got in a fight to protect me and I feel different about him now (self.confessions),"Sorry if this doesn't belong here. I don't have anyone else I can tell. I'm 19 and a guy. My mom married my stepdad when I was 14 and we've always gotten along. My dad died when I was 11 and to be honest I'm still working through the relationship we had. I've always had this fantasy that he was an amazing dad but if I'm honest he was abusive. He made me fight a 13 year old when I was 10. When I said I was scared he told me I was being a pussy. When I didn't win he was disappointed in me. When my mom married my stepdad we kept to ourselves at first but he's honestly twice the man my dad was. It's hard to say that but it's true. The one thing he said to me before he married my mom was that he'd never hurt us and always protect us. It's been 5 years and he's kept his promise. He's always been amazing to my mom and me and I admit that he spoils me sometimes. He'll take care of my chores for me and gets me whatever I want even if I don't ask him for it. If he hears me talking about something he'll just get it for me. He always asks if I have enough money and if I don't he'll transfer money into my checking account. We don't really talk about personal stuff but he's always said I can talk to him about anything whenever I feel like it. Today we were at the store and some older guy accused me of giving him a dirty look while we were in the parking lot. I didn't know what he was talking about and told him I didn't even look at him but he shoved me to the ground. My stepdad jumped in so fast that I didn't even see what happened. I heard him hit the guy and when I got up the asshole was on the ground looking scared and holding his nose. My stepdad was shouting at him in a scary voice ""You don't ever put your hands on him."" He helped me up and the guy got back in his car and sped away. After that he didn't want me to leave his sights in the store. The whole way home he kept apologizing that he didn't step in earlier and telling me he never wanted me to see him fight. I've never even seen get mad or raise his voice. It was scary but it also made me feel so weird. I can't explain it but it feels like I finally know how much he loves me. We never say it to each other but I always knew how he feels. When we got home I told him I love him for the first time and he gave me the hardest hug I've ever had and I almost started crying. tl:dr: My stepdad fought someone to protect me and it opened my eyes about our relationship Edit: I'm overwhelmed by all the nice comments. I wish I had time to answer them all before I go to work but I'll be late if I do. Thank you to everyone for the comments and awards!",Snoo-11156,https://old.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/hsnl0h/my_stepdad_got_in_a_fight_to_protect_me_and_i/
confessions,I think I pretty much hate conservatives now (self.confessions),"Used to be a centrist, slightly left leaning. My wife is a non-white legal immigrant, and the amount of bullshit we’ve had to go through to have her be in the country with me is astounding. We also lived in a pretty conservative area during 2015-2016, and I got to witness a fair amount of racism toward her. When they called the election for Trump a few of our neighbors walked down to the end of the court, stood in front of our house (the only one on that street occupied by a brown person) and lit firecrackers, cheering and yelling. We found a big pile of dog shit on our front porch the next morning. My family has a lot of conservatives, both Trump supporters and some never-Trumpers, and we tried being very non-confrontational with them: the idea was for my wife to be an immigrant in their lives that they were forced to love, which would hopefully break the caricature of immigrants as murderers and drug traffickers. She wound up being used as the example to justify their hate. Like if someone accused them of racism, they’d use her as a shield: “I love this one particular brown person, so obviously I’m not biased against them as a group” followed by a bunch of blatantly racist Fox News talking points. They love my family, they just want families that look like mine to be as rare as possible. We got sick of it. After struggling with these issues (and her green card, which has been going through “additional review” ever since shortly after the inauguration) we moved to a super liberal area and just disengaged from all the conservatives in our lives. We’ve never been happier. I can’t see Trump supporters on the news or in social media anymore without a great swelling of bile in my throat. I think I legit hate them as a group. The hypocrisy and ignorance are just boundless and I can’t fucking stand it. There’s nothing substantive to their ideas: it seems like nothing has to work or be consistent; anything that is pissing off liberals is doing its job. I can’t imagine being in that camp and not being an utterly shit human being. I’ve never been so consistently angry at anyone or anything in my life, and I can’t imagine that it’s ever going to go away. So I cut myself off from them. And I don’t miss them one bit. Fuck them. *Edit: Some of these comments were actually really helpful. There appear to be quite a lot more calm, reasonable, non-spiteful conservatives out there than I had given credit for. Legitimately, thank you for your perspective. I’ll try to take it to heart. There were also a few hundred people who commented (or PMed, oh, the PMs!) helpful stuff like invitations to suck their dick, or ideas on how best to kill myself. And I guess I should thank you too, because I’m not angry anymore. I’m just kind of amazed and sad. The barrel truly has no bottom. “So I had some bad experiences with conservatives, and it left a bad taste in my mouth. I’ve been struggling with being angry about it and -“ “NUH UH SNOWFLAKE, THAT SHIT NEVER FUCKING HAPPENED YOU SOY-BOY CUCK! YOURE MAKING IT UP! YOU’VE NEVER HAD A BAD EXPERIENCE WITH TRUMP SUPPORTERS EVER YOU COMMIE DIPSHIT! WE’RE A TOLERANT AND LOVING PEOPLE BY NATURE AND NO ONE IN A RED HAT WOULD EVER DO ANYTHING RACIST SO GTFO MY COUNTRY WITH YOUR ALIEN WIFE AND MONGREL KIDS! YOU’D SEE WE’RE GREAT PEOPLE IF YOU HADN’T LET THE MEDIA BRAINWASH YOU AGAINST US, AND I HOPE YOUR FAMILY GETS CANCER!” It’s like a fractal made of irony. And assholes.

confessions,The woman I married is not the woman I have loved the most. (self.confessions),"I have been with my wife for 14 years. She is an amazing spouse, partner, and mother. She is a great woman and I’m happy with the beautiful family we’ve made. That being said, my one true love is a woman I was with right before I met my wife. This woman and I dated for 3 years. She changed my life with her love. She introduced me to so much. When we were together everything was electric. I could listen to her talk for hours and just enthralled by her. She was the only person I trusted enough to poor my heart out to. Even my wife I can’t do this with. She was my perfect match. Compatible in every way. No one has made me laugh like her, made me feel pure unadulterated happiness as her, and I have never been with a lover that I have felt as physically and emotionally connected as her. If there are soulmates, she was mine. In the short time we were together we planned out our lives,together forever. Unfortunately, she needed to leave the country. Her parents were in an accident killing her father and leaving her mother in need of care. I was serving military commitment fresh out of college and I couldn’t go with her. We tried to make it work but when it became clear we wouldn’t be together for another 3 years. She became more withdrawn after the accident and resented me for not being able to be with her. I could feel the separation was slowly destroying us, so I set her free. It broke me but it seemed like the best thing for both of us. I don’t think I’ll ever forget our time together. As much as I love my wife, I know the love between us is not as real as me and my ex’s love. I married my wife out of convenience and I grew to love her. A few years back I got into contact with my ex again. She is married too with kids but she has also never forgotten and is still in love with me and wishes things could’ve been different. We talk sometimes nothing is ever inappropriate, I of course would choose my wife and family over her any time but if I saw her in person again, I’d be lying if I said I wouldn’t be worried something inappropriate might happen.",repentandtoss,https://old.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/oujzhe/the_woman_i_married_is_not_the_woman_i_have_loved/

confessions,I am responsible for the deaths of several people (self.confessions),"Around 4 years ago, I was a vendor on the darknet. It was a relatively shortlived thing, I was just doing it because I was too lazy to get a job and at the time didn't want to settle for the 9-to-5 thing. I wanted to start my own business, and use the drug money as a start up. I had been using myself for years, along with that I met lots of people into the dealing scene, and eventually started dealing myself. I have a lot of anxiety though, so I hated meeting up with people in parking lots and I definitely didn't want anyone to know where I lived. That's when I read about the Silk Road, and Ross Ulbricht being caught. Got obsessed with the idea of it, got obsessed with learning OPSEC, all with the goal of eventually using my connections to start up my store. Well, after a couple of months I did. I started my store with 3 drugs: ketamine, meth, and some outdoor weed my buddy was getting for super cheap. All was going good for a few months, had a couple thousand get stolen in an exit scam, but I had about $25,000 saved at that point so it didn't ruin my life like a few vendors I knew of. Eventually, I met a local connect that came into town only once a week, but had fucking ANYTHING I wanted. Mescaline, LSD, mushrooms, PCP, even... and... fentanyl. At the time, people weren't REALLY cutting heroin with fentanyl. I mean, I'm sure people did plenty, but it was not nearly as commonplace now. People just... did fentanyl. And still do. I put all my addresses into an excel spreadsheet along with their name, zip code, order, along with the amount. At the time, I was selling some super white powdered mescaline. The fentanyl was also a white powder. Very similar consistency. Long story short, my Excel fucked up, or I fucked up, and about 7 peoples mescaline orders were filled in as fentanyl orders. They all went out, I didn't notice and kept doing my thing for a few days. After about 5 days, someone contacted me and told me their friend died from my mescaline. I immediately called bullshit, and went to check my order log and scale up how much I had of my mescaline left. Well, I had about 11 grams more than I should have. I still don't know how the fuck it could have happened. I wasn't a user, but I was definitely high off dabs. I went to check my order log on the market to see if anyone had finalized on their purchase, and a couple of them were.. but none from a specific day. Including the person that messaged me. No one that had purchased mescaline that day had finalized their orders. The market I was on also had a feature to see the users last activity, and none of them had logged in in at least 3 days. Most 2 days. I immediately deactivated my vendor account. I didn't even need confirmation, I knew what happened. I knew I just killed several people. I sold the rest of my drugs, converted my bitcoin to cash, and moved the fuck away. Didn't speak to anyone for weeks. Found a job in a restaurant, living in a city I always wanted to. I haven't touched drugs since that day. I haven't had anything to do with that life since then. I still think about them. Every night. I saved their names and Googled them a few days later. I was able to find info on 4 customers that definitely died. One customer shared it with a friend. They both died. I don't know why I'm even posting this, mainly because I have no one to tell, and even if I did, I don't think I could. I spend my days sober. Clocking into work. Clocking out of work. Coming home. Playing video games. I'm a complete recluse. People I used to know have distanced themselves immensely, and I know it's because I'm a shell of my former self. I can't help it. Could I even tell a therapist about this? I don't feel like I deserve to be alive. Am I really living anyway? I don't even know anymore. Maybe this will help me feel better.",mesc997,https://old.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/bxoc1j/i_am_responsible_for_the_deaths_of_several_people/
confessions,I slapped a child in the face and then shoved him off his scooter. I'm 25. (self.confessions),"So I have a beloved kitty named pixy. She was around 4 when I found her on the street. She had a rubber band tightened on half her tail. I spent 2 weeks feeding her until she was comfortable enough to let me near her, she didn't trust anyone. I took her in, cleaned her up, and got the dead portion of her tail amputated. After 5 years, she finally warmed up to people and she became so sweet and friendly. It took her years to be comfortable around strangers. Last month, she was out for her daily stroll around the neighborhood and immediately came back in through the kitty door 20 minutes later. Usually she is out and about for 2-3 hours. She had 2 small holes in her chest, and one near her butt. She was completely frightened and was crying/meowing, she wouldn't even let me go near her for the first 5 minutes. I knew for certain that she was shot with metal bb's. I take her in my car and start driving to the vet, but took a quick detour around the neighborhood, I was going to take the long way to see if I could find the culprit. Sure enough I see a kid on a scooter standing on his driveway, with a Co2 powered bb gun, aiming in the drainage cavity by the sidewalk. I see cats in there all the time. It was then I knew who the culprit was. I parked the car, got out, walked over to him and said ""I'm telling your parents that you are shooting cats."" He replied ""they are pests, they told me I could."" The smug little look on his face threw me over the edge, I slapped the fuck outta this bitch, and kick sweeped his legs out from under him and watched him fall flat on his ass. I then picked up his gun and smashed it on the ground. A small part of me wanted to finish him off with a stomach kick for good measure, but I'm fucking 25 so I looked both ways before crossing the street, and fucking bolted. As I hopped in my car and sped away, I heard him shreaking in the distance. My kitty was treated, and is doing OK. She is a lot more skittish and spends less time outside. Edit: in case your wondering, I'm pretty sure the cops were called. When I came back I saw a few strolling around, I was sure I was d.o.n.e. I've never been In trouble or done shit like this. Anyways, I drove by and literally nothing happened.

confessions,I caught my mom (who I thought was an angel) having an affair on my dad. Now I can’t stand her and see her for the sociopath she is. (self.confessions),"I grew up loving my mother dearly as most sons do. She was protective, kind, beautiful, successful and smart and was someone I strove to be like when I was young. However, I wasn’t seeing the side of her that is at her core and within the past 3 years, I have come to despise her. She is selfish, manipulative, two-faced and an overall bad human, which is a tough pill to swallow when I adored her for 25 years. It’s weird how you don’t really know your parents until you become an adult. This will be long and if just one person gets through it then it was worth writing, I just need to get this off my chest. My parents are in their late 50’s. My dad is very successful (owner of his own business) and is an all-around good guy, great father to my sisters and I, and is a way better husband than my mom deserves. They’ve been together since they were in high school when in their sophomore year, my mom literally pulled a girl out of his Jeep and got in because she wanted to be with him (red flag). He is more passive, and my mom is aggressive (obviously). Any honey-do list he got, he did it. Anything my mother wanted, she got. His brother and even I always gave him shit for being so whipped. They went into over $90,000 in debt when I was 13 because my mom wanted a big house, Mercedes, and other crap they couldn’t afford at the time. We went on expensive vacations that she planned, we ate a nice restaurants we couldn’t afford, and the only thing my dad ever stood his ground on was that he gets to deer hunt with the guys 3 weekends a year, which my mom still bitched about being left out of. She has always had to be the center of whatever he does in life, no exceptions. But that isn’t what made me see her for who she was. Four years ago, my now wife and I were soon to be married. My mom suggested we all take a motorcycle trip one weekend (My dad and I ride together often) with her old coworker, we’ll call him James. She explained he was going through a tough time with his ex wife and needed to get away. We go and have a good time for a weekend, but it just felt weird. It was my mom, dad, my now wife, and James. The dynamic and overall vibe of being around my mom’s old friend was strange. He was a nice enough guy, he was tall, handsome, rich and brawny. He had an ex-wife and two kids around my age, and he loved taking pictures of my mom and dad, which creeped me out. Anyways, nothing of importance happened on this trip, but my mom starts acting strange afterwards and my dad and older sister are the ones who noticed it. At this time, I lived with my fiancé on the other side of the city, but my older sister was living with my parents because she was in grad school and was recently divorced after 1 year of marriage (found out he was an addict and spent all their money). One night, a few weeks after our motorcycle trip, my fiancé, sister, mom and I went to an incubus concert. My mom was acting weird, wanting to smoke pot, downing beers (this isn’t like her at all) and just being weird in general. It was like she was a whole different person all of a sudden. After being there for 10 minutes, she said, “I’m going to grab a beer”, and gets up and is disappears for an hour. I went looking for her after she had been gone for 45min as I was concerned for her safety and when I came back with no luck, I ask my sister if she’s been able to get ahold of her. She rolls her eyes and goes, “I didn’t bother calling, she’s probably calling James.” ….WTF? She then drops a bomb and tells me she and dad suspect she is having an affair with him. She goes on to explain how sketchy she has been acting, doing things like changing her phone and iPad password, stepping out for phone calls and whispering, even putting a fucking jar of rocks on her phone while she slept so she would be woken up if anyone touched it I’m assuming…idk, fucking weird. My dad managed to look in her phone before she changed her password and quickly skimmed through her texts with James and saw some suspicious cryptic dialogue. My mom finally gets back to us at the concert and at this point I am pissed and devastated all at once. I ask her what took so long (she didn’t even have the beer she left to get), and she says, “oh I ran into some old friends from my old job at ____”. Immediately sensing bullshit (what are the chances her 50+ year old friends ALSO went to see Incubus). So, I ask who. She didn’t expect this follow up question but slyly responds with, “you don’t know them”. I then ask, “well what are their names?” She’s feeling the pressure and stutters before managing to make-up some bullshit names. My wife and sister are listening to my interrogation very intently while Brandon Boyd is killing it in the background singing ""pardon me"". I get sick of her BS and drop it. I am livid and crushed and thinking of my dad. My sister had already gotten to the point of disgust I was at, so she didn’t say anything and we all kind of ignored it until the next day. After this concert incident, my sister tells my dad what happened, and he finally approaches my mom about everything. He demanded to see her call history and see’s a 45min call to James at the time of the concert, along with many others. He demands to know WTF is going on and she says he is just going through a hard time with his ex, who is apparently debilitated from alcoholism, and she was just helping him get through it as a friend. Anyways, to keep any readers interested, I am going to skip past the shit that could make this the longest read ever. Basically, the sketchiness goes on for months, and at the time of my wedding, my dad has a tracker in her goddamn car, has requested call logs from the phone company and is looking at hiring a private investigator. I still remember dancing with her at my wedding, she looked at me adoringly and I couldn't look back at her. Little did my dad or I know; me and my love for my kayaking would soon give him everything he needed. A month or so after my wedding, I go to stay with my old college roommate for a weekend of kayaking and fishing. He lived by my grandparent’s lake house (my mom’s parents) and I was going to pick up my kayak from their house that day. My dad randomly calls me just to say hi and probably tell me about whatever sketchy BS my mom had been up to (though probably not healthy, he is my best friend, and this had been our convos lately). I tell him that I’m headed to the lake house and he responds “I doubt she would be this bold, but your mom said she was at the lake house with her girlfriends this weekend and I want you to be prepared if that isn’t the case. If it isn’t, let me know.” I knew what he meant. I didn’t give my mom a heads up that I was coming on purpose and as I drive up, I’m relieved to see just her car and another girly looking car in the driveway. I call my dad before going in and tell him my initial assessment is that nothing sketchy is going on from what I see, just looks like her and her friends are here. He’s as relieved I am. I walk up, knock on the door and it’s silent. The back-patio door is unlocked so I walk in. The first thing I see is a leather motorcycle jacket hanging on one of the barstools and immediately recognize it as James’. My heart starts pounding and my adrenaline is pumping as my vision gets all weird and my ears start burning. A million questions went through my head in a second, like “are they here?” – “do they know I’m here?” – “should I announce myself?” – “god dammit mom you fucking cheating asshole!”. I act fast, assuming they aren’t there but could be pulling up any minute. I take a picture of the jacket, I go to the garage and sure enough, James’ motorcycle is there. I take a picture of that and then run back in and see cell phones stacked where they are charging in the kitchen. I grab a phone I don’t recognize. It didn’t have a lock on it so immediately go to the pictures…. first one is of two people I don’t recognize, as well as my mom and James… and they’re kissing each other on the lips. I scroll a little and more of the same shit. My heart is pumping out of my chest at this point and I take a few quick pictures of the photos in the phone and run out of the house, not even remembering or caring what I had originally been there for. Something I should add here, when I was 7, my mom left my dad for a doctor, who just wanted to use her and drop her like a bad habit, and my dad reluctantly took her back after she begged and pleaded. She blamed the doctor at the time, saying he drugged/raped her or some bullshit. My dad later told me that at the time, he told himself he was doing it for the kids and had planned on leaving her after we graduated HS, but they did so well in between then and our graduations that he eventually forgave her and was happy in their relationship. I remember them being separated, but I didn’t know the details until I recently. Okay so anyways, I peel out of the driveway at the lake house, and drive to a secluded street in the neighborhood as I try and figure out wtf to do. I let my heart-rate slow a bit, so I could think more clearly and then called my little sister, trying to decide if I tell my dad and if so, how. Up to this point, everyone just had their suspicions with no solid proof. My little sister, who is the sweetheart of the family, agrees that I needed to call dad and tell him immediately because he deserves to know, despite how bad it will hurt him. I then called my wife and she agreed but we were both worried what he would do. I hesitate for a bit but eventually I call my dad to tell him his wife of 25 years is cheating on him. When he answers I just blurt it out “James is here, I have proof and mom is cheating on you.” I didn’t know how to put it delicately, so I just gave him the facts. He was in shock like me, he kept saying the same phrase over and over “No fucking way...god dammit (insert my mom’s name), god dammit…wow…son of a bitch, God dammit.” After the initial shock wares off, he apologizes that I had to be the one to see it and then says he’s on his way (it’s a 3hr drive) and that he will meet up with me at my roommates. I immediately call my uncle (my dad’s identical twin and my other best friend) and tell him what’s going on. I tell him I’m afraid my dad is going to do something stupid. He said he’ll make sure he doesn't. They end up coming down together and meet me at my roommate’s house. We talk for a couple hours and come up with a plan. They switch trucks with my roommate to go incognito because he must see it for himself. My dad promises he wont do anything stupid despite what he may see. He sneaks up there after dark, parks far away and walks a mile through the woods with his brother and a pair of binoculars. He hides behind some trees when he got in place and sees them on the patio with another couple drinking wine. They’re cuddling and kissing like they’re an old married couple and like what they are doing is not beyond fucked up. It took every ounce of self-control for my dad not to run over there and go insane on them. Instead he did the smart thing thankfully and just took pictures of them and left. The next morning, he cleared out their bank account, sent her the pictures he and I took along with a text that said, “I know everything, I’m leaving you.” I can only imagine what their reaction was like. I rest assured that the rest of their little getaway was quite stressful. The next year was a nightmare for everyone and my mom’s reaction to this solidified my disdain for her. She dragged everyone into her bullshit and made our lives a living hell. My dad and I caught her red handed. He just wanted her to go to James and let him live in peace, but instead, she dropped James and begged my dad to take her back. My dad agreed to pay her alimony if she granted him a divorce without lawyers that would’ve drain them both financially. She reluctantly agreed. After the divorce, my mom cried every day for a year. She moved in with my little sister in an apartment she couldn’t afford. She got on anti-depressants and went into a downward spiral that, because we loved her no matter what, took us all with her. All the lies she had told for a year began to surface more and more. Thinking back on that motorcycle trip where I spent a weekend with this prick made my stomach turn. I even bought that rich asshole a whiskey and coke. Though I despised who she was and what she had done, I was still very concerned for my mom and would listen to her sob on the phone and in front of me. She cried to my wife a lot which I hated. This was my wife's first year in the family and my mom was calling her bawling about how cruel my dad was being to her. My mom blamed my dad’s twin brother for almost everything, saying he had stolen him away from her on all our “guy hunting trips,” and he was the reason their marriage fell apart. She was truly manic. My mom’s parents and brother were disgusted with her because they loved my dad so much and they refused to talk to her about it, so my wife, sisters, dad and I were the ones who got the brunt of it. She tried manipulating everyone to make us think she was the victim here. It made me sick. She tried to make it seem like she was the battered wife and my dad had treated her badly. We all knew the truth and I found myself despising her more and more as person. My dad on the other hand, went full blown frat boy with his newly found freedom. He’s a handsome guy with money, and though my mom’s reaction was taking a toll on him in every way, he distracted himself by getting on bumble and banging a bunch of 30-40 something year-old women, hunted every weekend, and went on Harley rides during the week to escape it all. My mom still doesn’t know about the women and honestly, after being with the same woman for 30 years, being cheated on twice, and having every aspect of his life controlled, he deserved it and needed to get it out of his system. Anyways, getting us more towards the present, my wife and I became pregnant with our first child and the joy of it was completely overshadowed by my mom’s constant meltdowns. I couldn't even get them in the same room to tell all my family that they were going to have a new niece/granddaughter. For 10 months, she relentlessly berated my dad for not being able to forgive her and used my unborn child (their first grandchild) as a pawn to get him back. She told him that it would be his fault if their grandchild grew up with divorced grandparents. It made my blood boil. After a while, and against me and my sister’s encouragement for my dad to stay strong, my dad caved and slowly started to get back with her. They sold their house and now live together in a town home. My daughter is 17 months old now and my parents have fallen back into their relationship of my mom dominating his life, despite him trying to set strong ground rules this time. It’s been like when a villain get’s their power back after losing them. She went from weak and broken, to manipulating everyone to her will like she has always done. My wife is shy, caring and always worried to offend my family in any way, and my mom uses this to try and boss her around when it comes to our daughter until I step in. She'll constantly play the guilt card about how my wife's parents see our daughter more when they live 4 hours away. Uhhh yeah you fucking psycho, they're good people. When I talk to my mom now, there is never love in my voice. I don’t want to hate her, but her flaws are so apparent. She’s a sociopath who has to be in control everyone. We all love her despite this, but I am the only one who calls her out on her bullshit. My older sister barely speaks to her. My daughter is obsessed with her and it makes me happy and furious at the same time. She doesn’t deserve my dad, and she doesn’t deserve our forgiveness, especially since this is twice now (that we know about) that she cheated on my dad. Not sure how to end this. Just wish my mom wasn’t such shit bag. I guess I’m thankful these events and my realization didn’t happen sooner, other wise I wouldn’t know that there are good women out there and instead I’d probably have a a hard time trusting them. If you made it this far, thanks for reading. Edit: Just want to thank you guys.

confessions,I am having such a hard time keeping my adoption secret (self.confessions),"I've been a foster dad to my son since he was 5. He is now 9. He's been through a lot and has made significant progress. I am so proud of him. I've been trying to officially adopt him and have spent over $30,000 over the last two years to make it happen. He has no idea. The social worker came by to visit and I told him it was to see how he was doing, but he was worried that I might be getting rid of him so he's been very anxious and clingy, but I've been a bit emotional too. I am getting the paperwork all signed and sealed by my lawyer this Thursday (when the dumbass judge comes back to work). I want to surprise him by showing him that he is officially my son, although he always was and will.

confessions,My wife doesn't really know why our sons got into a fist fight with each other (self.confessions),"We have 16yo twin boys who pummeled each other a few weeks ago. It took me and a neighbor to break them up. My wife was upset and stunned because they really don't fight. I told her it was because one didn't clean up after himself and it escalated from there. Teen boys, hormones, etc. I don't her to forget about it and not to bring it up because they were ashamed. She let it go and held onto the belief that her sons are sweet little angels. The truth is that they got into a fight because Twin A stole Twin's B last condom and Twin's B's girlfriend didn't have an Plan B. So Twin B wasn't going to get laid and attacked Twin A. My wife thinks Twin B is a virgin because he has a baby face and told her so. Why did Twin A steal his condom? For sex. With another boy. My wife thinks he's the one who is going to be a manwhore with women because he has so many female friends. EDIT: People making comments about the condoms. Twin B was getting them for free at school, but the school closed. He didn't plan on that happening. He didn't want to stash them up because my wife will freak if she found them and she does go through his stuff. His girlfriend had Plan B, but also ran out and doesn't want to ask her mom. His girlfriend will not have sex without a condom or Plan B. That's why I don't buy him condoms.",ReasonableReply0,https://old.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/fy6d70/my_wife_doesnt_really_know_why_our_sons_got_into/
confessions,I steal hermit crabs from souvenir shops (self.confessions),"You know those hermit crabs they sell as pets to tourists in coastal souvenir shops, the ones with shells that have badly painted cartoon characters on them? The ones that come free with the purchase of a little plastic carrier with a thin layer of brightly colored gravel, some flake food, and a shallow water dish with a sea sponge in it. Maybe your parents let you get one while you were on vacation as a child because it's such a simple little pet, and maybe it lived for a few weeks or months or even a couple years in that little plastic box before you noticed a bad smell and found it dead. And maybe you shrugged it off because it's just a little crab and they don't live long right? Those crabs have a lifespan of 30+ years. Those crabs are highly social and need to be kept in groups. Those crabs require air that's around 80% humidity or higher in order to BREATHE, and kept at around 26 C/80 F. Those crabs need separate pools of both fresh and salt water (using marine aquarium salt) that are deep enough to fully submerse themselves in so they can regulate their internal salinity. They need large enclosures with deep substrate to burrow down in so they can molt. They need a varied and nutrient-rich diet with fresh fruit and veg. The little crab you got as a souvenir in the same place selling custom airbrush shirts and shark-tooth necklaces died a slow and miserable death. It's a miracle it made it that far to begin with, as all the hermit crabs sold in these shops (and major pet retailers) are collected from the wild. They have their natural shells broken off their bodies with a hammer so they have no choice but to wear some kitschy garbage with Spiderman painted on it. Roughly 50% don't survive the process and no one seems to care. I care. Several years ago I was in one of these shops and saw hundreds of hermit crabs kept in a bare, unheated open-air cage with only a shallow dish of water. I could smell them before I saw them, dead little bodies rotting in their shells and limbs strewn about. Children were encouraged to pick them up and play with them and beg their parents for one because they're hardly more complicated than a pet rock, right? If I bought some of them I could give them a chance to live, but in doing so I'd be supporting a cruel industry and funding the death of so many more. I'm not sure how long I paced around the shop with my moral dilemma before a sudden realization hit me: I have pockets. As casually as I could, I picked out a couple sickly crabs and gently put them in my pocket. My heart was racing but no one stopped me when I walked out the door. And so started my life of crime. I don't do it often, but if I'm in a town with one of those souvenir shops I'll pop on in and jailbreak a few hermit crabs. I gravitate towards the weak ones and those missing limbs. They're on their way out but I want them to have a chance, or to at least die as comfortably as they can. The ones that've pulled through are all healthy and active now; a colony of contraband crabs. I love the background noise of their shells clacking against their terrarium and each other as they go about their crab business. I'm a little drunk and sentimental tonight which is my excuse for writing all this. I have a feeling most folks won't care to read it all but I hope they do and somehow it'll make a difference.

confessions,"I clean up my house every morning and come back to it trashed after work, and I couldn't be happier because of it. (self.confessions)","So, I hate cleaning the house, sometimes I enjoy getting in the groove to some music, but mostly it's just tedious and I don't get any help with it. When my, now wife, first moved in together, she was going through a bout of depression and for a few years I would go to bed with her, wake up and go to work, and come back home most days her still sleeping, or if awake has yet to leave the bed, with her only really being up when I was home. So everyday, the living room was the same way it was the moment I left, some times going weeks being untouched and it started to make me feel lonely because it was like I lived by myself all over again. As if Nothing happens when I wasn't looking. Growing up in a family of 6, with many pets, and alot of stray acquaintances(My folks allow friends and family to bum off us when going through tough times as a sort of halfway home); there was never a dull moment in the house, for better or worse, which made it feel like it was home. After no small amount of therapy and constant love, care, and commitment, she's been slowly cracking through her depression with only occasional bad days. And we have recently had our lovely daughter join our life. We just moved to a new area and a new house, my wife plays with the kid in the living room, gets her changed in the child's bedroom, makes herself and the little one some food in the kitchen now that she's eating more solids, and our little one destroys what ever she can get her hands on. Coming home to see my daughter crawling over mommy as they watch PBS, my wife laughing and playing, my house in a lovely mess of activity and life, and I couldn't be any happier. Well if I could get hand with the dishes, that'd be nice, but with such a big victory, I'm not going to complain too much just yet.

We have a shared bank account so it’s not quite the “it’s her daughter and her money so what’s the deal” kinda thing.. we argued for three days over the issue, we couldn’t afford to spend another $1200 on my son to even out the budgets again at a ludicrous $2200 each.. my son would have never if know we spent an extra money on her but that’s not the point.. it’s unfair and in my opinion it’s favoritisms.. After another very heated argument over the issue. I walked over to the tree, grabbed her present. Opened it in front of her, and then rewrapped it and addressed it to my son.

confessions,I stole my son's teacher's keys (self.confessions),"My son has Asperger's which is like autism-lite. We've done extensive therapy and intervention and for the most part he is no different than any other kid his age except he comes across as shy and a bit nerdy (saying that with love). The only issue we had at school was that he would become overwhelmed, panic and run out of the classroom. Of course that is not okay. We and school decided to allow him to take quick breaks to decompress when he starts feeling overwhelmed. He has not had an ""incident"" since the 3rd grade. He started the 6th grade last year and it's hard for any kid, especially for an Aspie's kid. We met with all of his teacher's and reminded them that he has this accommodation in writing and he will likely need to use it since middle school is tough for an Aspie kid. All but one of his teacher's understood that and were supportive. His math teacher is just a nasty bitch. She's one of those teachers that should not be a teacher. We're not those crazy in-your-face parents. We just want what's best for our son and work with his teachers to do so. We kept on reminding her, verbally and in writing, especially as our son's anxiety started to grow around her. Imagine my surprise when I get a call from his counselor telling me to pick my son up. Apparently he had bolted from her classroom and ran out to the field. The principal and a counselor tried to escort him to the office and he refused unless they called me. It horrified me because I've seen videos of cops being called and tasering or hitting special needs kids. When I got there, my son was very upset. It was like watching years of progress unravel. Apparently, he started to feel overwhelmed in her class because she's a bitch. She tuned on the heat too high and closed all the doors. He felt trapped and claustrophobic. When he asked for a break, she refused and told him to sit down or get detention. That only fueled his anxiety more and he exploded. The school quickly accepted that the situation was handled poorly by the teacher. I requested that he switch classes and even threaten to get a lawyer for not following the accommodations that they are required by law to follow. That got their attention quickly. They did not send him back to her class; rather he went to another class until the matter was resolved. The teacher did get into trouble and wanted to discuss it with us before pulling him out of her class. We met with her and she was just a nasty bitch. She accused our son of using his diagnosis as a crutch and he needed to grow up. I wanted to slap her. She went to take a phone call and I saw her keys on her desk. I put them in my pocket and we finished our conversation and I politely thanked her for her time. Then I threw her keys in a dumpster and got my son pulled out of her class the next day.

confessions,"Mistake at 35,000 feet, people could have died. (self.confessions)","I recently took a short vacation to a lesser developed country. On my last night I decided to sample some of the more exotic local fare and had a mixed seafood dish which was quite good. All was fine until the flight home when I started feeling a lot of pressure in my abdomen. I could tell I wasn’t going to shart, so I leaned over a bit and poofed out a bit of gas, smooth as silk. I was giving myself a mental high-five when I realized that what was supposed to have been a sly poot turned out to be a horrendous stench bomb that instantly engulfed several rows fore and aft. Little babies started crying immediately, while the adults let out short barks that registered somewhere between shock and despair. In a display of primal instinct, a couple of teens sitting across the aisle reflexively pulled their tee shirt collars up over their mouth and nose. The gas was so dense and foul that I thought I could maybe see it clouding the air in the cabin. A flight attendant up front noticed the commotion and bustled down the aisle, but upon entering the contaminated zone, instantly spun on her heel and beat a hasty retreat. There was no way I was going to fess up and apologize, so instead I just scowled and pretended to look around for the culprit. Fortunately things cleared out pretty fast. I didn’t dare try it again, I had taken my fellow passengers by surprise the first time, but now they were wary and fully alert. For the rest of the flight, anyone that made their way back to the lavatory was subjected to the scrutiny of a hundred eyes. We landed and I deplaned without further incident, however, I did totally trash a toilet in Customs, but that’s another story.",,https://old.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/b8z6x0/mistake_at_35000_feet_people_could_have_died/

confessions,Not getting married was the best decision I ever made (self.confessions),"Me (29M) and my partner (28F) met 8 years ago just before I graduated and we clicked almost immediately. A few months after I graduated, she and her 3 year old son moved in with me. Right after graduating, I started making low 6 figures working for a large bank and then went on to do my own thing having a very lucrative career. My income was more than enough to support the 3 of us so I was comfortable letting her stay home, work on her hobbies and volunteering. I thought our relationship was going well, she's been pressing me to get married for the last 4 years but the time never seemed right because I wanted to get my own business off of the ground first and she seemed comfortable with that. Last week, she asked me what I thought about open relationships and whether we could open ours. I know why she asked, I spend a lot of time travelling for work and she probably wants some action on the side while I'm away working, hell she might already have something on the side. I knew right then we were done but I needed to find out how screwed I was before pulling the trigger. I set up a meet with a lawyer my friend knew and I have to admit I was scared, I'd heard stories of how men were raked over the coals in divorces all the time so I walked into the lawyer's office expecting to lose 50% of everything and more. At first things looked bleak but then he asked how long we had been married. When I told him that we weren't married, he called me ""The luckiest mf to ever walk into his office"". Common law marriage doesn't exist here which means that when we split up, she gets precisely...nothing...zero...zip...nada.

I push back against the hate and homophobia and judgmental nature of so much Contemporary American Christianity. But I don’t believe the underlying myth, and I have to pretend that I do. Overall, I believe I’m doing more good than harm, but there’s a dishonesty at the center of it that I have to try to ignore. EDIT: A lot of great discussion here. A couple of clarifications: I’m not economically dependent on ministry work. I work outside the church and do my ministry work on a voluntary basis. I used to get a (very) small stipend but gave it up a few years ago when I no longer needed it. I wonder all the time whether I am lying, or just withholding (or whether that’s a BS distinction.) I strive only to say what I believe, but it’s a stretch. When I say God is Love, I really mean Love is God - the highest power. Certainly not Christian orthodoxy. I try hard to teach only what I believe - Love, grace, care for others, etc. There are not many other forums where I could deliver that message in the same way. Not an excuse, just a fact. I appreciate the concern of those who feel I’m defiling the faith. I disagree, but humbly. They may be right. I would hate to hurt those who have trusted me. Thanks for all the encouragement. Thanks for the honest criticism. Reading the comments here is a bit like living inside my brain. To everyone: “... but the greatest of these is love.” Another edit: Thanks to everyone on this thread. It’s remarkably civil and thoughtful. It’s brightening my day. Last edit: this post is almost 24 hours old, so it’s about to die off. But I genuinely thank everyone who participated in such good faith, which was most of you. Whether you offered encouragement, supportive resources or even gentle (or harsh) condemnation based on your deeply held beliefs, I appreciate the conversation and challenge. I read every comment (ok, I may have skimmed a few of the wall-of-text jeremiads to find the main point) and I responded to as many as I felt I productively could. You’ve all given me much to think of and I wish you joy on whatever journey that you are on. Again, to all my new stranger/friends and to those who want nothing to do with me, shalom.",ericdavis1240214,https://old.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/b7n5po/im_a_pastor_who_doesnt_believe_in_god/
confessions,"I was attracted to minors for a number of years, and it ruined my life (self.confessions)","I wanted to say from the beginning that I have never touched or hurt a child, and never will. Obvious throwaway for obvious reasons. How it all began was when I was around 15 or so, I started to become attracted to girls around me (I went into puberty very late). As I grew older, instead of my attractions growing in accordance with my age, they never moved, which lead me to continually being attracted to girls of that age. When I was a minor, it wasn't such a big issue, but when I became an adult it was. When I turned 19, I made the decision to essentially become a recluse. I did not want to hurt anyone, but there were many emotions fighting inside of me. I had urges that I had little control of, and it was a mission every day to avoid following through on them. It came to a head one day when I was speaking to the daughter of a friend and the urges almost overwhelmed me. I almost broke. This was the point when I shut myself away. I would only go out when I knew that children were at school, or wouldn't be on the street (after dark). I avoided media involving children. I avoided books involving children. Most days I wouldn't go out at all, only going out after dark, if at all. I took jobs where I could work nightshift, so that I didn't have to have any contact with children. This made my life absolute hell. I became a nervous wreck. I would get anxiety if anyone came to the door - incase it was a child. I still worked, but my performance was poor. This often led to me being fired or disciplined. No one else knew what I was going through. By necessity it was something I had to endure alone. Around 7 years ago, I found a psychologist. It had gotten to be too much and I had to speak with someone about it. Over the course of the next six months, we discovered that my sexual feelings were brought about by my being sexually abused at a young age. When it was happening, it was frequent and often violent. As it turns out, I had repressed most of it. I didn't know how bad it actually was. However, discovering this lead to that revelation. Over the course of three years of twice-weekly treatments, my feelings towards minors began to fade. Slowly, but surely, I started to get better. I owe my psychologist my life - literally. I was at the point of suicide before I started seeing him. Now, 7 years on, I have no attraction towards minors. I have a much more normal life. I can actually go out during the day without being anxious. I can talk to children with no urges. I am mostly normal. I am still dealing with the repercussions of my dark times, but the dark times themselves are over. I'm married, and I have a baby boy on the way. The process of getting treatment is so freeing. I can't even describe it now. My psychologist is the one who suggested writing this out. He thinks it will help with my healing process. I hope it will. Thanks for listening. EDITS BELOW: First and foremost, I want to thank you all for your support and kind words. My wife and I are in tears reading all of the messages you folks have sent my way. When I wrote this, I expected condemnation and negative responses. I could not have dreamed of such warm and heartfelt responses to my post. To respond to some questions posed here: My psychological treatment was a blend of Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy and Exposure & Response Therapy. Those two therapies lasted for about 18 months, after which we moved into Acceptance & Commitment Therapy, which also helped a great deal. It was hard for me to find a psychologist who was willing to take me on. I live in the American South, so psychologists weren't cheap, but my psychologist was interested in it from an academic standpoint, so reduced his price for me in order to study my disorder and my mind in general over the long term. I ended up paying around $50 a session, instead of the $200 he normally charged. I had a fair amount of money saved to pay the psychologist, as I tend to live a frugal life. Not spending a lot of money on things that most people do for fun or in social situations led me to save a lot of money in general. The one who abused me was my father. My mother didn't find out about this until the abuse had been going on for a number of years. I had never understood why my mother and father split, but once my memories began to resurface, I spoke with her about it. Upon finding out about the abuse, my mother immediately left my father and left the house. She eventually moved us across the country. My father was convicted of 2 counts of rape and 5 counts of indecent assault of a minor and was sentenced to 8 years in prison. After 5 years of incarceration, he committed suicide. After leaving my father, my mother looked after me alone for the next 6 years and then found a new partner. She married him a year later and I am glad to call him my father. I am still seeing the psychologist who treated me, though, on a monthly basis now. In regards to the urges I had, they were different from normal attraction. The best way I can describe it is like an addict looking to get more of a substance. There is this compulsive need that is always lurking in the background, always poking at you to find it out. I would find myself compulsively planning to do horrible things to get what I desired, which is why I shut myself away from society. Thank you all again for your kind words and support. It means so much to me.",throwaway847677,https://old.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/d03h8q/i_was_attracted_to_minors_for_a_number_of_years/

confessions,Something scared me and my brother really bad when we were younger and I’m just now remembering the details... (self.confessions),"We were watching one of the Garfield movies (I can’t remember off the top of my head) and everything was well until the song “I feel good” by James Brown started playing in the movie. Now, you may ask, what could’ve scared you so bad from a song like that? Well I’ll tell you. In the beginning of the song James Brown does this sort of scream I guess you could say. Well me and my brother had no idea that it was a part of the song and we thought the scream had came from somewhere in our room. After hearing the scream we immediately ran to our parents room and told them we heard someone scream from inside our room, so my father jumps up and grabs a knife from the kitchen and walks into our room to find nothing in there. So now everyone in the house thinks there’s an intruder so we all go lock ourselves in my parents bedroom and call the police. Police show up and find nothing. I was watching the movie with my niece the other day and heard that familiar scream and realized that it was only the movie and we’d had the police called for no reason at all.

confessions,I had a small victory with my Dad and it's making me happy. (self.confessions),"My dad has Asperger's and is notoriously difficult to deal with. Growing up he never really told me that he loved me or hugged me; he just assumed that I knew and wouldn't say it. It was a difficult time, having a dad that didn't understand your emotions or any sort of affection. But he does love me. How do I know this? For his birthday, I made him a small leather bracelet (just a simple band). The inside had an expression he often used with me growing up, and the outside had the nautical coordinates of the dock he used to take me fishing at every Saturday morning when I was a kid. It was our thing. We wouldn't talk, but I liked being outside and I knew he liked it because every weekend, without fail, he would ask me if I was ready to go fishing, no prompting from Mom. He simply called me to say thanks for the gift, and he hung up. I didn't think much of it. But anyways, my mom called me yesterday and asked if I had told her neighbors about the bracelet I made Dad. I was confused; I had not told them. She said that she hadn't either. She told me that they were talking to her about what a great gift it was and we're asking if I could show them where to make one like it. We realized Dad must have been talking about it to them, and actually showed them. Dad NEVER talks about things he likes, especially to strangers. She then told me that he's been wearing ot almost every day (again, this is a man who is not about adornment) and she saw him sending a picture to his brother. He might not say it, but that's how I know he misses me. Hope to see you soon, Pops.",,https://old.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/at5c41/i_had_a_small_victory_with_my_dad_and_its_making/

confessions,I have a surprise for my sons when they comes home (self.confessions),"Things were going well and then bad stuff happened. For almost two years, we were not sure if we were going to be on the streets, but it seemed likely. I barely got by for a year, but we had to do without. I am so ashamed about this. A father should be able to provide for his sons, especially when he is a single father. I just take solace in that we played it off that we were not poor. For example, my 9yo has not had a proper bed for three years. Just a rollaway bed. It was nothing short of a miracle that I got the job that I got a year ago. It literally saved our lives. All of a sudden money isn't an issue. I had to still live on a budget because it was too good to be true. Now I know I am doing a good job, my boss is happy with me, I am raking tons in OT, we have good insurance, etc. I ended up finding a spacious house last month (not apartment like we live in now) well within what I can afford right across the street from their school and park and have been secretly filling it up with new furniture this month and had movers move in all of our stuff today. They're both are actually at the park across the street right on a playdate and seriously have no idea. EDIT: Thanks for the support. It sorta backfired. I met them at the park and their friends were picked up. They asked where they car was because they were cold. I pointed to the car in a driveway and they were confused. I told them that was our new home. They were even more confused and slightly disturbed. I took them to the house and told them to look around and all of their stuff was there including new stuff. They asked about the apartment and I told them we had moved out so we could live in a bigger and better place. It wasn't that they weren't happy but they were overwhelmed and blindsided. They wanted to know why I didn't tell them and were worried that if I had forgotten something at the apartment then they weren't going to be able to get it back and felt excluded. Today they were a bit more relaxed and explored the house. They're getting used to having a kitchen sink (we did not have one at the apartment) AND a dishwasher and having a front and backdoor and a backyard that's all theirs. I'm pretty sure in a few days they will adapt to it and won't miss their old place.",Right-Ad,https://old.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/e2pfml/i_have_a_surprise_for_my_sons_when_they_comes_home/

confessions,My daughter died 5 years ago today and a part of me is glad about that. (self.confessions),"Makes me sound horrible. I know. I would never say this out loud to anyone ever. Though I said daughter, she wasn't technically my daughter. She was my sister's child. My sister OD'ed when the baby was around a year old. I was 19 at that time and in college. I got custody. I never wanted children. I wanted to be a doctor. I wanted to go a different path than the path my family took. But I felt responsible to take her in. So, I dropped out. Took care of her. Loved her. Life was hard but we got by. I was working any jobs I could get and I didn't have any life. I didn't have any friends. I didn't have any time to date. I was either working or at home taking care of her. At times, I felt like I didn't even have time to breathe. 6 years passed. One day, her school bus was in an accident. 3 children died that day including my daughter. I was devastated at first. Depressed. Lost. I was even homeless for a little while. I didn't have any family. I didn't have any friends. All I had was haunted memories in that city. So, I moved to a different city to get a fresh start. Reapplied for college. Graduated. Currently, I am in year one of medical school. I got married a few months back. I feel like finally I am living the life that I wanted to live. Achieving what I wanted to achieve. Take a different path. Do something different. Live a better life than my alcoholic father, runaway mother and drug addicted sister. I loved her. I would have taken care of her like my child if she had lived. I know that. But there is a part of me that is glad that she is gone. It makes me a horrible person. I already know that.

April 2016. 10pm at night and I get a little hungry and decide to head to the nearest store to grab some food. It would be closer to walk than to drive so I head out the door and proceed to walk the two blocks to the store. The streets are quiet and empty and to the far distance, I see a white woman park her car and walk to her apartment entrence. She sees me from the corner of her eye and I can tell she's nervous. She proceeds to put the key in the door lock to open but by this time she is shaking and drops the key. By then, I've gotten closer and am only about 20 feet away from her. She looks at me terror-stricken and begins to scream from the top of her lungs, banging on the door for help. I proceed to walk right past her and head to the store. I didn't do anything. I was just a black man walking to get some food. And for some reason, I couldn't help but think I was the one in the wrong. I felt guilty for making her feel so scared.

My sister and I weren't really clued up on what normal families did. For as long as I remember, I cooked the stuff I could, washed my own clothes, if my mum was too wasted I would cycle (about 5 miles up steep hills) to school, and generally looked after myself. I didn't know how often people changed bedsheets or brushed their teeth. Simple things you'd usually learn from family went a miss. I didn't even know how to wash dishes manually since we had a dishwasher. It was a weirdly embarrassing moment learning how different I'd been living before boarding school.

confession,"I stole over $20,000 in a very creative way in the 90'sNo Regrets (self.confession)","I worked at a fast food chain in the 90's when I was in high school. When I worked there they were in the process of phasing out denominational gift certificates. ($5, $10 & $25) The way is worked was if you spent more than half of the certificate they gave you the cash back. So if you ordered $5.50 worth of food and gave them one of the $10 gift cards, they gave you the $4.50 back in cash. My manager was in charge of destroying all the existing certificates as we transitioned to the more traditional credit card looking gift cards. So my manager said he shredded the certificates like he was supposed to, but one night when I was closing I found two boxes of the gift cards tucked deep in the dry storage room. They were FILLED with the certificates that were supposed to be shredded. So, I scooped them up, brought them out to the dumpster in trash bags and threw them away. After we closed, I came back and recovered the back, and brought the certificates home. I counted them. There were 1,000 $25, 1,000 $10, and 500 $5 certificates. None of them had expiration dates. Total haul was $40K in fast food certificates. My manager never said a word, he couldn't. He had reported them destroyed weeks earlier. Over the next three years my girlfriend and I toured every location in our state, and the next 4 states ordering food, and getting the change. We never kept track on a spreadsheet or anything, but we got good at knowing what menu items were just about half. After the first year, we started saving the change in a shoe box, and let it build up. I bought my first car for $7,800 cash from the change. And for some reason A kiddie cone was $1.05, if you gave them a $5 cert they gave you $3.95 back. We threw away a lot of kiddie cones. Edit: Holy crap this blew up. Here are the answers to some of the FAQs We could hit 10-12 stores in a day if we drove around for 5-6 hours. Both of us would use a gift cert. it was not that labor intensive. The only cameras in the store were at the cash registers & take out window. The manager has no clue who took them, or at least never treated my differently. Each gift certificate had a generic PLU on them. E.i. All the $25 were PLU #756. When we stopped selling the certificates we were told to keep honoring them because they were pre paid. They were not coupons. One can only eat so many ice cream cones.",AlBundy758,https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/8j8dho/i_stole_over_20000_in_a_very_creative_way_in_the/
confession,Our elf on the shelf is dead forever and I am so relieved (self.confession),"Last year my son (then 9) decided elf on the shelf was not real when he had a friend over. Touched it, picked it up, threw it on the floor and later electrical taped it to a robot vacuum. My youngest was watching and laughed and I thought, finally, nobody believes in this annoying elf anymore. So, Pinecone the elf disappeared after that. This December, my youngest child asked if elf on the shelf was coming back and I told her no, pretty sure her brother had killed him forever. And, I don’t even feel guilty because the holiday season is so much less stressful without it. To all parents, do not get sucked into getting an elf on the shelf. They will be the bane of your existence for years to come. edit Apparently lots of people have strong feelings about the elf. The kids and I had an awesome holiday. We went to Christmas festivals and school programs; they were in a holiday play, we made Christmas cookies and all of the typical holiday joy and not once did we miss the stupid elf. If the elf works for your family, that’s great. And I mean that sincerely. If you’re hanging on by a thread and your cup is empty and one more thing to remember is the last thing you want to do, be kind to yourself. Your kids would rather spend time with a less stressed parent than to have all this extra stuff.",Superb_Writing845,https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1hcmsxr/our_elf_on_the_shelf_is_dead_forever_and_i_am_so/

confession,I killed an elderly man in front of his wife and basically his entire family. (self.confession),"Forgive me for any misspellings or format I’m trying to do this on my phone. I haven’t talked about this to anyone (even though it’s been years) even my closest of friends, minus the ones that were there. One nite when I was in college I was driving to get some liquor for a party my fraternity was supposed to throw the following night. I was taking a street I was very familiar with to get back to my house. It was dark but the street was lit with street lamps. I remember that I looked at my radio for a second, just a second not very long at all. But when I looked back up to the road there was a man crossing. I didn’t have any time to react, by the time I saw him he had already hit the good of my car and bounced off the side. I remember screaming and hitting the brakes, and the wash of horror of what had just happened. I’ll admit I had thought about speeding away, but I pulled over to the side and ran out of my car to check on this guy. When I got to him his family was standing outside the restaurant he was leaving and they were all screaming and crying. He has laying on the side of the road with blood coming out his nose and mouth. Two other men were standing with him trying to see if he was alright and calling 911. All I could say was “I didn’t see him” I was frantic by the time it had set in what I had done. I sat on the curb across from the family and listened to their crying in agony while we waited for the paramedics to arrive. I sat there and sobbed while to paramedics took him away in an ambulance. I don’t believe I’ve ever cried so hard and for so long. The worst part about all of it and what still kills me today was that his wife came over to me while I was distraught on that curb, sat next to me, placed her hand on my shoulder and said “I was married to him for almost 50 years. We had a good life.” Then she hugged me and said that she forgave me. After everything was said and done it was ruled that it was an accident. I wasn’t charged with anything and I had one of my friends pick me up from the police station. I went down a dark path the years after that. I drank heavily, dropped out of college in my senior year, and had to move back in with my mother and father because I couldn’t hold on to a job. Even tried to kill myself with pills. It was a hard road to recovery (witch I feel I’m not fully recovered from nor do I feel I ever will be the same). But eventually I got my life back in order. Joined up with the Navy and saw a bit of the world, and now I’m on track to go back to college and hopefully finish what I started there. It took almost a decade but I finally start to feel almost whole again. I’m back to hanging with my friends, and actually going out. So maybe there is a light at the end of the tunnel. Wow, you guys are awesome! Thanks for the support and feedback. I’ve never really posted anything on reddit before because people can be assholes, but all these kind words are moving. Thank you!

confession,I’m a nurse and I 100 percent judge people based on their veins (self.confession),"Okay, so I know this might sound weird, but I have to confess something. I am a nurse, and I definitely judge patients based on their veins. If you have big, straight, beautiful veins, I instantly love you. You are the MVP. I could get blood or start an IV with my eyes closed. But if your veins are tiny, hard to find, or moving around like they are trying to escape, I am already mentally preparing for a struggle. I always stay calm and professional on the outside, but inside, I am either celebrating or quietly panicking. So yes, if you have ever wondered whether your nurse is silently evaluating your veins, the answer is absolutely yes.",Figgs_7,https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1k5pge9/im_a_nurse_and_i_100_percent_judge_people_based/
confession,"I slept with my daughters ex boyfriend, he got me pregnant and I had an abortion. They got back together and got married.Remorse (self.confession)","This was back in... let me think, maybe 1997? I was 38 and my daughter was 18, and she was dating Harry, who was 24. I was an alcoholic and dabbled in other drugs, mostly cocaine. I was not a good person, let alone mother. Not like I was abusive to my daughter or anything but I was generally inattentive and cared more about my alcohol and drugs than her, especially in her teen years. I am 14 years sober now. I disproved of my daughter dating harry, but I never told her why. He would flirt with me, constantly, and the age difference also creeped me out. Also, he was an alcoholic and drug user, just like me. She broke up with him over his alcoholism. Soon after she moved away, not too far but regardless she didn't live with me anymore. Harry kept calling me and asking if we wanted to get drinks, I turned him down, but then one day he said he had a bunch of coke and I couldn't resist. He came over, we did the coke, and we ended up having sex. He was a very good looking guy. He looked A LOT like that ridiculous 80s justin beiber picture that was on the front page today, that is actually what made me think about him. For the next few months, maybe like 3-4 months, he would sometimes come over and we would have sex and do drugs and get drunk together. Any drug addict knows what that is like to have a drug addict buddy in that way. Then I got pregnant. I knew it was by him, I had sex without a condom a few times stupidly. I never told him I was pregnant, and I went and got the abortion and kept it a secret. Anyways, I stopped seeing him after that, it was too weird. I also got sober, for like 4 months, before relapsing. Fast forward 2 years and my daughter contacts me and tells me that she got back with Harry, and that he is fully sober. I was mortified honestly. He was gonna tell her that we slept together, and she is going to hate me for life. They came over one day and said hi, and when my daughter was gone, Harry told me that there is no reason to tell her about what happened. I agreed. Its been 16 years of marriage on their part. They have a kid together. Harry got cancer, then beat it. I got sober. That's basically it. I don't see them very often, they live in texas and I live on the east coast. But whenever I do there is always that tension between me and Harry, its literally the first thing that comes to either of our minds, I can just tell. Not like sexual tension, like ""why did we have to do that? What the fuck is wrong with us?"" kind of tension. I think about this often. Especially when I see my grandson. I always think that could have been my son if things had gone differently, but WOW what a disaster that would have been if I decided to keep that child.",kasamaherm55,https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/9hpsab/i_slept_with_my_daughters_ex_boyfriend_he_got_me/
confession,Found out my dead best friend was in love with my wifeLight (self.confession),"[Light] I'm writing this as a confession because I don't know where else to speak about this and I don't want my kids finding this out on my main account. My friend died a few months back due to heart problems. He was taking care of himself so it was a shock to everyone. Especially his wife who was with him at their house when he died. Due to this she decided to move somewhere else and because she and her daughter were still distraught she asked me to pack up his stuff. He had some boxes in his basement and after a while I started feeling nostalgic and decided to look into them. I found pictures of us from when we were kids all the way to before we got married. That was enough to make me feel bad and I just got back to taping them up. But one of the boxes seemed to be in much better condition, so I decided to check it in case it was something important. To my surprise I found out pictures of him and my wife from when we used to hang out together, as well as more recent pictures from family reunions. The most recent being from my wife's birthday party. Alongside the pictures there were letters that he never sent her. The first one dated 2 months before I met her. The last one was also the same date of her birthday party. There was one that stood out the most was one from after I started dating her. He wrote that his time had passed and since my happiness was as important as his own he would watch over us. I'll keep his box safe since it isn't my secret to reveal.",mysxcv,https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/7l2a34/found_out_my_dead_best_friend_was_in_love_with_my/
confession,I used to reprice steaks at my work when I was younger (self.confession),"When I was 18 I worked at a piggly wiggly grocery store. After the meat department guys went home at like 3pm it was part of my job to restock meat on the sales floor throughout the night. At the time my mom worked nights and my step dad would always be passed out drunk when I got home so there would never be dinner for my brother and me. I'd always bring him home whatever he wanted (usually junk food like hot pockets, chips, etc) and I went through a huge steak phase, my family was kind of poor so we almost never got steak, it felt fancy to me. So I would go find the thickest steak we had in the cooler and change the sticker price so instead of being like $11.99lb it was $1.99lb making it exponentially cheaper. I did this probably twice a week for over a year and was never caught.",Carricriss,https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1ielqrc/i_used_to_reprice_steaks_at_my_work_when_i_was/

confession,My weight loss wake up call was seeing how ugly my sister is (self.confession),"I'm overweight, as you can garner from the title. I've been trying to lose weight for years now, and while I have had some results, I am still technically clinically obese, though not morbidly. My sister is also obese, but is closer to morbidly obese than I am. Yesterday, I went on Instagram and her profile popped up, so I decided to scroll through it since I haven't seen her in almost 5 years and don't really look at my family members' social media. As I was scrolling, I came across one of her selfies and was hit with the realization that her face is my face. I had never realized just how similar we looked, but her selfie was the same face I see in the mirror everyday, and I'm horrified. I know it sounds awful, but my sister has always been the ugliest of the kids in my family, so realizing I look at all like her is not particularly pleasant. I realized that one of the reasons we look so similar was because of our face shape, very round and pudgy. Seeing her and realizing how ugly I think she is and realizing how similar we look has given me extreme motivation to lose the weight and keep it off. I can't do anything about our facial features without surgery, but hopefully by losing weight I will be able to think that we look different and won't feel so awful about my appearance. Anyway, I know that I'm an awful sister for saying so bluntly that I think my sister is actively ugly, but it's true. And it's not just her face, she also doesn't take care of herself, has hair that's been overdyed and is stringy and gross now, and recently got several face piercings (you can have your own opinion, but I think they're ugly 99% of the time). I'm probably going to see her in just over a year, so I really need to lose the weight by then for fear that anyone will comment on how similar we look.",Alone_Accident_1467,https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1jum9yq/my_weight_loss_wake_up_call_was_seeing_how_ugly/

confession,"I Let a Stranger Hide in My Apartment, and I Don’t Know If I Regret It (self.confession)","This happened last year, and I still don’t know if I made the right call. It was around 11 PM, and I had just gotten home from a late shift. I live in a small apartment in a not-so-great part of the city, so I’m always a little on edge when walking home. That night felt… off. As I was unlocking my door, I noticed a guy standing at the end of the hallway. He wasn’t doing anything, just standing there, but something about him made my stomach drop. I got inside, locked the door, and tried to shake it off. Not even five minutes later, someone knocked. Hard. I froze. It wasn’t my neighbor (she texts before coming over), and I don’t really have friends who drop by unannounced. Then, a voice - “Please, can you just let me in for a second?” It was a woman. She sounded out of breath, almost panicked. I looked through the peephole, and there she was, maybe mid 20ish, wide eyes, glancing down the hall like she was being followed. I know, I know, stupid move, but I cracked the door open just a little and asked her what is going on. She whispered that there’s a guy, he’s been following her since she left the train. She didn’t know where else to go from there. That’s when I realized. The guy I saw earlier... My heart was racing, but I stepped aside and let her in. I locked the door immediately, turned off the lights, and we just stood there in the dark, listening. A few seconds later, heavy footsteps passed my door. Slow. Like someone was looking for something. Then… nothing. She stayed for about thirty minutes, just sitting on my couch, shaking. I offered her water, and we barely talked. Eventually, she called a friend to come pick her up. When she left, she just said thank you and disappeared down the hall. I never saw her again. I don’t know if she was telling the truth. Maybe she was genuinely in danger. But I think about that night all the time, and I can’t decide if I did the right thing… or if I got really, really lucky.",404-NotFoundIRL,https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1iundet/i_let_a_stranger_hide_in_my_apartment_and_i_dont/
confession,I tell work I'm bringing my lunch allowance home because I don't have time... but I do (self.confession),"I 24(f) noticed sometime last year that my wife, also 24(f) wasn't packing proper lunches. She was taking one slice of chicken and putting it between a tiny slice of bread that would have been lucky to have butter or mayo in it. It's not her fault, I don't pack a lunch so buying all the ingredients for sandwiches that may just be thrown out because they wouldn't be used in time felt pointless. Especially because we don't have the money to be doing that. So in work I get a lunch allowance of whatever I want, but I just say I'm not hungry or don't have time to eat it and wrap up some nice sandwich or wrap so my wife can have it for her lunch. She gets so excited and happy, she texts me every single day thanking me for the lunch gave her and tells me how delicious it is. I find it fun too cause it's like a little present for my wife. And its not like i was gonna eat it anyway. When I have time I like to get creative. I'm a chef so I'm able to pick on different food throughout the day, but I graze throughout the day because I want my wife to thrive. Today she has a wrap that has mixed leaves, mozzarella, grated carrot and red cabbage, chicken tenders, crispy bacon, onion and Caribbean sauce. This is a regular enough lunch for her because it's her favourite one. Even though I already know, I can't wait for her text to tell me what she thinks, that woman makes my heart so warm.

confession,Neighbor Tried to Sabotage Our Fence. Now He Has No Yard Access. (self.confession),"I live with my mom in a quiet neighborhood. She’s the kind of person who waves at everyone and bakes cookies for new neighbors. Harmless, really. A few months ago, a guy who just moved in next door decided our side fence “violated property codes.” It didn’t. It was already there when we bought the house and had been approved by the city years ago. Still, he filed a complaint. The inspector showed up, checked the paperwork, and confirmed the fence was 100% legal. No action needed. Neighbor was annoyed. He wanted it down to expand his yard access. So I looked into his property. Turns out, the gate he installed on the other side of his yard (which he used to access the alley) cut directly through public utility space and worse, he’d paved part of it. I sent a detailed complaint to the city, with photos and documentation. No drama, just facts. A month later, the city not only ordered him to remove the gate, but also fined him for unauthorized pavement over public land. He now has to access his backyard through the front of his house, walking all the way around. And our fence? Still standing. Perfectly legal. Mom even planted flowers along it.

I say sure and she confesses that she had a years-long affair that ended about 2 years ago. I smile and say that's not uncommon and not so bad. She then gets very serious and says that's not the bad part. He recently died of cancer and she so wanted to see him before he died but she couldn't (her husband actually knew about the affair, but his wife never did). She was on the verge of tears saying she couldn't even go to the funeral, but she did go to his grave afterwards. She couldn't talk to her husband about it, she couldn't talk to anyone. I wanted to ask her more questions, but she stopped me. She got herself together and left to join her husband. Before the evening ended she talked to me again, with other people around. Big smile on her face saying what a great fun conversation we had. She asked to exchange numbers, which we did. She started texting me 2 days later, giving me a bit more details about the affair, explaining that she really loved the guy and missed him terribly.

confession,I held on too long and all it did was hurt my daughter (self.confession),"My daughter had multiple congenital birth defects that led to a lifetime of complications. With medically complex kids you fix one problem and create two more. She lived 11 years. It was probably 9 years too long. She lived most of her life in hospitals. Literally months at a time. She would sometimes be home a week or two and then end up back in. I don't think she ever spent more than two consecutive months out of the hospital in her entire life, until she went on palliative care. She was more comfortable in the hospital than anywhere else. How sad is that. She was the ""warrior"" kid. That was her whole identity. Making cards for her nurses and decorating her medical equipment and being Tough with a capital T. That was all she had. Never went to school, not in any meaningful capacity. Never played a sport or an instrument. Never had any real friends to speak of. Never had the health to take up any real hobbies. Just an entire life made up of surgeries, shots and nurses and fucking medical equipment to decorate. I gave her a pathetic life. There wasn't a single intervention I wasn't willing to put her through to buy more time. She was the happiest, most accepting kid I've ever met but in the last six months she was done. I refused to listen. She asked me over and over again if she could just ""stop"". I would push until she shut up and went along with what I wanted. Why did I do that. She wanted to make me happy but she knew she was done. Selfish. She died incredibly agitated and upset. I think she was scared to let go because she knew what it was going to do to me.

confession,I take a very long lunch break in the middle of my workday. (self.confession),"This has been going on for 3 1/2 years now. I work remotely at a very large fortune 50 company, Monday through Friday, for 40 hours a week. At least those are the hours that I’m “on.“ Starting around noon every workday, I take a one and a half to two hour lunch break. I purposely block off my calendar with “busy work“ so no one questions what I’ve been doing. I honestly cannot find enough hours in the week to be able to do half of the stuff that I need to be able to get done, because that’s just part of my job. There is a ton of project management and follow up with various clients. But that’s just about everyone on my team. For some reason, my boss has never questioned me or been suspicious of anything. My intuition tells me that he might do the same thing himself on his remote days, although he has a hybrid schedule. And that’s not all. I have taken vacations before during lighter project weeks, where a lot of communication isnt required between me and my team. I took my laptop and logged on during mandatory meetings and then logged off right afterwards. I know there is a lot of talk out there by corporate CEOs saying return to the office is mandatory because of stuff like this, but I always hit my goals, I do everything that’s asked of me, and I exceed expectations every year during my performance review. Honestly, this is the first time in my career where I feel like I have a “normal“ work/life balance. I feel like this is what work really should be. 30-32 hours of core work, while enjoying life the way it should be enjoyed.

confession,My Aunt hit my mother so I dragged her across the floor and punched her till she passed outConflicted (self.confession),"My Aunt is a poisonous woman. Our whole family doesn’t talk to her. She’s done things in the past you wouldn’t believe. So she left our lives years ago. Recently she returned out of the blue at my moms house. My mom has 2 other sisters and a brother. My mom and aunt never got on. My mom is a lovely person but she could sense from a young age something was off about her sister, so she kept her distance. My Aunt was nasty and would hurt people’s feeling intentionally for no reason. She never had a partner or kids. She isolated herself from everyone. My Gran cut her off when she tried to steal thousands of dollars from her. We all genuinely think there’s something physiologically wrong with her. So back to where I was going with this....one morning I was at my moms house. Just chilling out and there was a knock at the door. So I opened it and there she was. She walked in, she looked like she had took drugs. She looked dead behind the eyes. I tried to stop her but she pushed me down. I honestly don’t know why she came to my moms house out of everyone. I quickly got up and she went into the kitchen she startled my mom and punched her in the face, my mom didn’t even have a chance to blink before she hit her. She went down like a ton of bricks. My heart felt like it had been sucked through into my stomach when I seen it. Something came over me, I don’t know if it was anger or adrenaline, but I ran up behind her and grabbed her hair and I dragged her out onto the back lawn and I bashed her face about 15 times, blood was everywhere. Thankfully no one seen me or I might not of been writing this right now. I got up and I left her there. I went to check my mom, she was in a lot of pain. I looked back out the window and she was gone. We told our family immediately about this and they were perplexed and angry as to why she just turned up and attacked my mom. I’m still so hurt and angry as I write this. But I also feel tremendously guilty and upset that I done that to her because I’ve never fought anyone and I’m not a fighter at all, but something came over me and I snapped. I can’t get over it for some reason. It just seemed so unreal and there was no reason for the attack. God forbid she had a weapon that’s truly scary to think about. We didn’t call the police. As I assaulted her badly and didn’t want it to bounce back on me. That’s another thing I feel ashamed about. But should I feel bad or not? I need others opinions as I’ve been bottling this up for a while. My Gran was devastated, she just wanted her daughter back but from a young age she took to drugs, spent time in prison and amount of other things.

confession,I got free coffee from Starbucks for about 6 months (self.confession),"About 15 years ago I was working in NYC and I would take advantage of the free refills that Starbucks had for drip coffee. The offer was really meant for people sitting in the store but I would buy coffee in the morning and then bring my cup back around 1 or 2p for another cup. Apparently in NYC, they weren’t allowed to actually refill the cup for health code reasons or something. So they’d throw out the cup and give you a new one. That’s when I realized there was a loophole here. I kept five cups and brought them home. Then I started bringing one in the morning to Starbucks and I’d get a free “refill”. I’d do this every day and I’d end up with 5 gross paper Starbucks cups at work and then I’d bring them home on Friday and repeat the next week. I did this for months, not paying for coffee at all, until one day I brought in my cup and handed it to the barista for a refill only to realize that all of the cups behind the counter were different. It was getting close to the holidays and they’d switched to their holiday logo cups. Well, color me embarrassed. I started paying for coffee again after that. It was a good run though.",mtgistonsoffun,https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1kei8hh/i_got_free_coffee_from_starbucks_for_about_6/
confession,I poured skunk tincture all along my neighbors windows so they’d be quieter. (self.confession),"They were so loud all the time. I tried talking to them, telling them my boyfriend and I work at a coffee shop and bakery and our hours were really early. I bribed them with treats I made. They were constantly opening their windows and playing their music so loud for hours at all hours. Even their conversations were loud. With their windows open, even with mine closed I would know when their mom was visiting, when their boyfriends weren’t texting them back, or when they got their nails done. I did everything to cover it up. Music of my own, fans for white noise, tv, etc. it’s like they knew when I was actively trying and stepped up their game to be louder. Eventually we tried talking to landlords, made noise complaints, everything. They just learned how to be sneaky about being loud. Eventually it got spiteful. Putting music in the window, screaming and banging on the walls. Our houses weren’t connected but there was maybe a max of 10ft in between with a sidewalk going through. I was getting really stressed out. Losing sleep, couldn’t relax in my house, was getting sent home from work because I was so tired. It got really bad and I had no idea what to do. Nothing we had done up to this point had worked. When I’d explain my situation people would come up with funny revenge ideas. None of them stuck like the skunk tincture did to me. I could feel it in my bones it would work. So I ordered some on amazon and one morning as I left for work I dumped it all along the side of their house that they keep the windows open on. It smelled so bad I was worried I was gonna get some on me and I’d smell bad at work. I didn’t. Fast forward a couple hours and I get a notification on our camera that there’s motion. It faced in between the two houses along the sidewalk, the place I dumped the tincture. One of the girls was walking back and forth up the sidewalk spraying the rocks under the windows with Lysol. I watched it for a while and more came out. One opened the window and pulled the screen off and wiped it all down. Eventually a maintenance guy showed up. Then the gas company. I kinda started to panic at that point. I felt kinda bad, like maybe I had gone too far. I don’t think they ever figured it out or suspected me. For the next 2 months those windows stayed shut and I barely heard anything from them. It was so peaceful. I couldn’t believe it worked.",billynotrlyy,https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1infm0b/i_poured_skunk_tincture_all_along_my_neighbors/

confession,I work with the elderly. And I can’t bloody stand them. (self.confession),"I work in a care home. Challenging behaviour, aggression, dementia, schizophrenia, health issues, bed bound, nursing, the lot. 80 plus residents, 4 units. I didn't realise until I worked in care how rude, arrogant, entitled, nasty, racist, homophobic some elderly are. Out of all 80 plus only about 8 are actually decent. They are so disgustingly rude it's unbelievable and this is even the ones who are non dementia. Dementia crowd are a different breed. Some of lovely, some are the most awful people I've ever met and before you guys go crazy and scream but it's their dementia!!!! Yes. Some of it. But there's still a human being under the dementia and there's no way calling one of my black colleagues a monkey, n*ga, wog and specifically attacking them for being black (or our Indian ladies) is new to them. That's been there for decades. One guy looked at one of our new african sponsorships and said ""get back on your banana boat and fuck off"" They treat us younger people literally like we are their maids, barking their every want at us when they can see we are busy. They hurt us, berate us, go out their way to make our job more difficult. One lady (non dementia) threw her dinner plate with her dinner on at me because I got her husbands sugar wrong in his tea. I was targeted and attacked my entire pregnancy. Zimmer frame to the stomach, punched in the stomach, spat at, had a carbon dioxide fire extinguisher sprayed at me when I was heavily pregnant, told I should be ashamed of my mixed race baby. One new entry came in and only lasted 4 hours before his previous care home was called to take him back as he chased me saying he wanted to kill me and my baby. I've had shit thrown at me, my hair pulled, dirty nails dug into my skin and scratched. Another guy threatened to rape my younger colleague which really upset her. They're just vile. I'm sick and tired of saying we need to respect our elders and they're sweet little innocent cuties. There's some really nice ones sure! And I absolutely love doing care with them. But the others are just so nasty. Edit: just an add on.. in my experience schizophrenic people (medicated) are the sweetest people ever. We have a gentleman who is on injections each month and he's a HUGE guy. Big, muscly, 6 foot plus. He's in his 60s and he's so lovely and often tries to protect female staff from other male residents.

confession,My mom caught my dad with a 16yo and covered it up. (self.confession),"Well, 16 years ago we had two of my friends and their mother living with us while they went through a divorce. I was 15 and my friends were 14 and 16. I was away at another friend’s house one night. When I came back the following day my mom told me she had kicked them out because the 16yo tried to make a move on my dad. She absolutely slandered that poor girl’s name. When I got into my 20s it still sat in the back of my mind. I just knew I didn’t get the truth. So I reached out to the 16yo who was also now in her 20s. We met up and I got the true story. I could see the pain in her eyes. She said she’d been in therapy for years because of my father. That he did it in such a loving way, it really fucked her up. She told me they’d been drinking on the property then went skinny dipping. All while my mother was in bed pregnant with my sister. They made their way into the house and upstairs. Where eventually my mother walked in on them. I let her know I had her back if she ever decided to do anything about it. I am now in my 30s and recently became a mother and it’s all I’ve been able to think about. They still don’t know that I know the truth. It’s reawakened the rage in me. Especially all of the teenage rage they made me shove down for so long. Because if anyone did that to my daughter, or if I caught my husband in that situation, HELLLLLLL NO. It was easy to shove down before because I learned from the best, my parents. But becoming a mother, especially to a daughter, I’ve never wanted someone to pay for something they’ve done so bad. I feel like if I brought it up to my mom she would just get angry and talk shit. She’d probably say the past is the past and I need to let it go. That people can change. But I know he hasn’t changed due to events over the recent years with his anger and control issues. He’s a very big narcissist who believes he can do no wrong whatsoever. And my mother is so far up his ass. It makes me wonder if the 16yo was his only victim. If she was, and if he’s never done it again, would that be okay? Is this forgivable? Because I don’t feel like it is. I want to tell the whole family, but I feel like they’d just downplay it and make me seem crazy. Cut me off and turn my siblings against me. They’ve done it before when I called them out on other things. So, here I am. Just needing to get it out I guess.

confession,"After 13 years clean and 8 years of marriage, I did heroin 3 weeks ago and almost came close to fully relapsing.Remorse (self.confession)","I was a heroin addict in the lower east side of Manhattan in the 1990s as a teen. I got clean at 21 years old after years of abuse. I got married at 26 to my amazing and beautiful wife. She knows I was an addict. I spent all these years not even really thinking that much about the concept of relapsing. It had been so long. I still thought about it, but with marriage and my kids and everything the thought of it was just so ridiculously out of sight to even consider trying it again. 3 weeks ago, it was my friends birthday. He is 4 years younger than me so of course he wants to go to some cool hip sketchy bar/club thing in bushwick. I got drunk, really drunk. I hadn't really drank much at all in the past few years so my tolerance was way lower than expected. There was a dealer outside and a few other junkies nearby. I don't even fully remember what happened, I just remember going with them, abandoning my friend at the bar (it was like 1am anyways), and going to some apartment and shooting up. I spent the night there, then all the way until noon the next day. I had 10 missed calls. I panicked when I came out of my daze. I told my wife I had gotten way too drunk and was puking and my phone was out of battery so I stayed at Charlies house. She was disappointed I didn't tell her but also thought it was funny because she used to tease me for not being able to handle my liquor. This was a ""I told you so"" moment, she had told me not to drink too much before I went to the bar. She wasn't even in new york, she was at a summer house with the kids in Massachusetts. I spent the next 4 days until they got back just... riddled with anxiety, urges to get more heroin, horrific mind zaps (I dont even know what to call them). It was, in some ways, worse than my withdrawal symptoms when I first was an addict. Not because of the physical feeling, but the horrible mental feeling of what I was possibly giving up, my wife and kids. I wanted to fucking get more so badly. I left my house to find heroin 4 fucking times. 4 times, I gave up to get more, but wasn't able to find any and snapped back to reality and went back home. I still thank FUCKING GOD I did not somehow run into some street dealer during those 4 times. I would have absolutely done it. I feel like everything I thought about myself, that I was strong, that my addiction was behind me, that I had beat heroin... it was all gone. I am not going to say I am back at square one or anything, I am not. But I feel like something inside of me has reset. My unwavering strength against addiction was broken at the slightest temptation. I still am weak. Heroin is so, so much stronger than me. Its truly unbelievable how much stronger it is than me. When I was young, my aunt had cancer. She beat it. Then it came back soon after, and she beat it again. It didn't come back, and we loved how strong she was for fighting her cancer and that she had overcome it. She lived with us. I remember her feeling of strength after her 2nd year of not having cancer, her 3rd year, her 6th year.... it finally felt like it was gone for good. Her thinking ""its finally behind me now, its a part of my past"", and then it just fucking came back. 9 years after her first diagnosis, it came back and killed her. I remember her feelings and how she felt about it. So many years after she thought it had gone away. That is how I feel. Like a cancer which I thought I got rid of a decade ago just showed back up on my screening. The first 5-6 days after I tried it that time outside the bar were the worst. My kids and wife have come back. The urges mostly went away the second I saw my kids. I hugged them so damn hard. And I never told my family what happened, nor will I ever. My wife never understood that side of me, she met me 5 whole years after I was clean. I just cannot have her know, ever. I won't do it again. I am planning on not drinking to excess like that again, except maybe in very specific situations like at the summer house where there is no option of drugs. I mean, not like I WANT to get drunk again like that, but just in case I ever want to get loose? I am never doing that in the city again. I am still about 90%+ sure that I won't ever touch heroin again. I am still positive in myself about it. Its just... it used to be 99% sure. That is what fucking terrifies me. I said heroin is stronger than me. It is absolutely stronger than me. But the reason I won't ever do it again is that it isn't stronger than my family, my wife and kids. I don't care about how good it feels, I will not subject my wife and children to me being an addict. I would rather just kill myself than that.",olrrtentr292,https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/9ps7y9/after_13_years_clean_and_8_years_of_marriage_i/
confession,8 years ago I caused a UFO panic (self.confession),"One college summer break 8 years ago my friends and I were bored. We remembered a demonstration from a high school science class of a ""Solar Balloon"". This was just a really thin black plastic bag you'd fill with air, seal, and then set out in the sun. The sun would heat the air in the black bag and the bag would become buoyant and float. We had the idea to find the cheapest/thinnest black plastic trash bags available and combine a bunch of them to make a huge balloon. We spent a few days driving around to Walmarts and dollar stores trying different brands to find the thinnest possible plastic bag and thinnest tape which would work the best. Finally we took a number of them, cut off the bottom ends, and taped them together into a huge balloon which we filled up with a leaf blower and then tied the end. After sitting out in the sun for a half hour or so we had done it! This is a picture a friend had taken as it was just becoming buoyant. We had to mess around with how the tape was sealing the bags to use as little of it as possible as the weight of the tape added up and made the balloon harder to float. Shortly after this the balloon got away from us Further This was dissapointing, but we made another one and got funny looks from cars driving by and were entertained for a bit. Shortly after that this new balloon met it's demise smacking into a tree and getting popped. Oh well, mission success. A few years later I happened across this news article. The balloon that got away had apparently blown a town over and caused a big UFO panic. People were calling 911, the police, and local radio stations about it. Our boredom unintentionally created a UFO panic in central NJ. I moved out of the area but when I get together with my friend we always bring this up and have a good laugh. EDIT: Wow didn't really think this would gain much traction. Also didn't expect any NJ Redditors to have seen this let alone the author of the article to show up. Glad everyone thinks this is funny but that being said please don't go out and do this on purpose. EDIT EDIT: Wow first gold ever.

confession,I (20M) have been hiding tens of thousands from my parents for years (self.confession),"At the start of high school, I was pretty broke as many high school kids are. To gain more freedom I worked hard to start my career as a 3D artist, and I was making a couple hundred every few weeks at best during most of high school. Even with how little I made compared to how hard I worked; my mom and stepdad would pressure me to chip in for the groceries and mortgage payments. Keep in mind, we aren't poor or anything, we were middle class, and they just wanted more financial freedom for themselves so they can consistently go on luxury vacations. I also have a few siblings (now in the higher years of high school) who they also do the bare minimum for, not bad enough to where it's child neglect but definitely not great parenting considering none of us could focus on our studies while having to work. The creative industry is difficult and unforgiving, and I put blood sweat and tears into my work to get where I am at this age. I'm not going to let them pressure me into making any big contributions to their finances so that they can keep going on excessive vacationing sprees. Only me and my girlfriend know how much I really make. I have been saving tens of thousands of dollars without anyone else around me knowing. One day they'll find out how much I have, but for now I will bide my time and take advantage of as little financial burden as possible. Once they do, I'll simply move out and be done with them. EDIT: Thanks a lot for the advice and comments everyone! Just to clarify, I do of course take care of my own expenses and my siblings' (since I wouldn't want them to be overburdened like I was) - I am not pitching into the household bills because they don't deserve it.

confession,I faked my resume and now I'm in the shit..........Remorse (self.confession),"Throwaway account for obvious reasons. Since I started High School, my parents stopped checking in on my grades and their mentality was basically ""we don't care as long as you get into a good university"" and they've carried on this mentality to when I got into college and they didn't really checked on my grades and gave me free rein as long as I majored in the subjected they wanted and graduated on time with good grades. Well basically what happened was that I failed my first year and had to switch my major. I didn't tell them and they didn't ask so I thought as long as I got my shit together and not drop out I'll be fine. One day out of the blue last semester my dad asked me to write up a resume. I panicked and wrote up a resume but changed the GPA and major and made up some shit and thought I saved myself. Welp, this winter break my dad dropped it on me and told me he knows people in a big company, he gave them my resume and everything and wanted me to intern there. So I am fucked. They'll probably figure it out and let my dad know and I'll probably get disowned or something, and best case scenario they don't check and give me the job, and I have to live with the guilt that I got a job that I didn't deserve cause of nepotism, this shit is depressing as fuck and I'm typically an easy going guy but this whole ordeal is giving me anxiety like nothing else. I feel like an ass for failing and lying to my family about it and now I'm on the verge of being blown and I thought maybe making a post here will make me feel better but I honestly don't know. Edit: wow this has blown up. In all my years of Reddit, the post that gets blown up is a confession post with a throwaway account.. talk about a wake up call. Anyways, I try to read all the comments I can. Some of you tell me to play it off and fake it till I make it, some of you tell me to come clean, some tell me to just disassociate from my family and do my own thing, it seems Reddit is just as conflicted as I am.

confession,I snooped on the CEO's email account and got myself unfiredLight (self.confession),"A couple years out of college I worked as an analyst at a pretty small private equity firm. The CEO was one of the biggest assholes I've ever met. He was fairly young in his 40s, a multi millionare, and the type of guy driven solely by money with 0 business ethics. He'd do anything to get the upper hand in a deal regardless of who it screws over...contractors, employees...I even saw him seriously fuck over a long time family friend of his without any remorse. Anyway, aside from my analyst role, as it was a really small business (only about 20 people in the office, and then a bunch of people working remote), I also happened to be one of the only semi technology-literate people in the company. So like many of my generation, I became the defacto ""Millenial Office Computer Guy"" too. Despite my lack of qualifications I got put in charge of handling pretty much anything minor tech related. Setting up servers....fixing laptop issues...answering ""How do I convert this to PDF"" questions...even basic network security. They thought I was some sort of computer genius...but really I was just mostly winging it, Googling pretty much everything. But eventually I got legitimately pretty good at all the tech stuff. They gave me bigger tasks like planning all of the computer systems for their owned businesses, and supervising installs. I didn't get paid extra for any of this mind you. After a couple years of serious bullshit working there, I was pretty worn out. I wasn't progressing. I hated working for captain douchebag...he treated everyone like shit. I was pulling 12-14+ hour days with no overtime or performance bonus. And they weren't paying me nearly what they should have. I also hated being ""the tech guy"" and was depressed as fuck basically living in a cubicle. So I decided I full on had enough of the 9-8 life working for assholes....and I would start my own consulting business working for myself. However, instead of quitting right away, I figured it would be smart to first build up my client base on the side while I was still getting a steady paycheck. So thats what I did. I launched my company, and landed my first clients. As the workload increased, I slowly started spending more and more time working on my side business while at my office job. At first I was pretty low key about it. But eventually, it was blatant. As it was a super small company....I was the only one who knew how to do a lot of important tasks and operate some key internal systems. It was easy for me to tell my boss a project was taking a whole week to complete, that I actually finished in 10 minutes. Pretty soon I was spending 80% of my day working on my own stuff in the office. I'd even take calls for my side business clients at my desk. The rest of the time I was usually dicking around on Reddit or something. Of course, we had systems in place to monitor network activity. But I was the person in charge of monitoring it. This continued for a while. As my own business ramped up, I cared less and less about the office job. And since I hated waking up early, I began rolling into work late. At first it was only 30 minutes or so. Then it progressed to an hour. When my boss didn't reprimand me...it became clear how much they needed me there. I took full advantage of this. Before long I was arriving around Noon, working for a couple hours, then heading home. My coworkers werent happy, but I helped them with all of their tech problems and they hated the company too, so they kept their mouths shut about it. My boss eventually said something to me about all it at one point, but I just came in on time the next few days and then went back to coming in whenever I wanted. After more than 2 months of coming in 4-5 hours late, and working on my side business in full view of my asshole boss, I couldn't believe I wasn't fired yet. I deserved it and felt it was inevitable. On a hunch, I decided to do a little investigative work. As I was the ""tech guy"", I also had full access to the company email server. So I logged into the CEO's personal email account, and searched for my name. Lo and behold, there was a recent email thread between him, my direct boss, and some other team members with my name in the subject line. Obviously I open it. They're discussing my recent performance issues...the last email in the chain basically said ""If nobody has any objections, I will be terminating him at the end of the week"". 2 days from then. I wasn't surprised, but I decided there was no way I was going to let these assholes fire me. Although I didn't give a shit about that job, I didn't want to have a termination in my work history. I also wanted to keep getting paid for a while longer. Of course, I couldn't let him know I actually knew I was getting canned. So, I formulated a plan to perform a little inception reverse-psychology mind fuck on the CEO. The next day, one day before they planned to fire me, I requested a meeting with him to ""discuss my current performance."". In that meeting I sat down, and he asked me what I wanted to talk about. So I told him (paraphrased): ""Look, I know I've been a shitty employee lately. I'm sure you've noticed. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I've been kind of getting the feeling you guys are planning to let me go soon."" When I said that the shocked look on his face was priceless...he must have thought I was psychic to work that out on my own the day before it was going to happen. I remember him just saying something like “uhh"". I continued while he sat flabbergasted. ""So I'll be honest with you, My heart isn't in this job anymore. As you know, I'm an entrepreneur at heart...which I’m sure you can relate to. I want to start my own company. However, as you're aware, I have a lot of responsibilities here nobody else can do."" I then proceeded to list all of the things I did and projects I was working on. I could see it on his face when the realization sunk in of how screwed he'd be if I left suddenly. ""So here's what I propose. You don't fire me. I don't quit. I keep working here for a month, finish my current projects, and train whoever you want on everything I'm in charge of. After a month is up, I will continue to come in once per week until its complete. After that, if you still need me...you can pay me on an hourly project-by-project basis"". I intentionally mentioned the possibility of me quitting so he could feel like he ""won"" the negotiation, even though I technically had him by the balls. He paused to think for a minute, then said something along the lines of: ""Okay. You have a deal"". So, not only did I get myself unfired...I actually turned the company into a paying client. During that month, I continued doing pretty much whatever I wanted since I had an expiration date (while training my replacement as promised). After the month was up they hit me up regularly for remote task work . I charged them triple what I was earning while working there, and barely had to deal with the CEO. my client base was big enough I dropped them for good. ...after all that, the CEO still calls me up for advice/questions nearly 3 years later. These days I just blow him off saying ""Sorry, I'm too busy"". Edit: As it seems there’s some doubt that this actually happened (it did), figured I’d clarify a few points. 1) This was a very small company. The office had about 20 people in it, and several dozen more worked remote. If you’ve never worked in a small office before, I can assure you it’s pretty normal for employees to wear many hats and take on random roles outside their initial scope. It’s also pretty normal for them to be severely lacking with network security and controlling passwords. 2) I did not become some “computer genius” and never claimed to be (tho my company of technology illiterate baby boomers sometimes thought of me that way). I had decent basic working knowledge coming into the job, and picked up more over the several years I was there. For anything complicated (like wiring, hardware installs, advanced networking tasks etc) we hired outside IT consultants. But I was the guy who would source them, hire them, supervise them and learn the systems they put in place. And I just handled more basic tasks myself . We’re also not talking about enterprise level security here either 3) my consulting business has nothing to do with private equity. Im not going to reveal exactly what I do for privacy sake since this blew up, but it’s in marketing. I didn’t steal any of my old company’s clients when I left and don’t compete with them 4) yes, Im fully aware and admit I was an asshole, hence posting this in /r/confession. In fact I decided to start my own company because I hate working for other people without my own skin in the game. I’m not a great employee when I don’t care about what I’m doing. However, the guys running the company were pretty shitty people, and I did not feel that bad about it at the time. The thing I did have reservations about was snooping on the emails. I do not condoned invading privacy like that. However, he’d freely given me the passwords (so I could help him set up his outlook, forwarding, etc), and I felt me getting fired was inevitably coming soon.",InthrowSted,https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/atmizg/i_snooped_on_the_ceos_email_account_and_got/

I kept noticing this girl would cheat off me and get the exact same score as me on every quiz or test. So I came up with a plan to make her fail a test. I purposely chose wrong answers on a multiple choice test, making sure she could see what I put. I put a small dot on the answer I actually thought were correct. I then acted like I was done and waited for her to go turn her test in. I quickly erased all my answers and changed to the ones I had dotted earlier. She had came back to our table and I could tell she was horrified when she saw me doing what I was doing. Long story short, she ended up failing the test and I got like an 80 something on it. I sort of rubbed it in too because I made sure to ask her how she did. I’ve only told a few people this story. One person told me it was kinda psychopathic so I felt kinda bad. But I just thought I was teaching a lesson or whatever I guess.

I picked it up and I remember wanting to give it back, but I was there to get Yu-GI-Oh cards (I had recently lost all my good cards to my friend in a bet) so this was a miracle of sorts to make a solid come-back. So I kept it, I thought the woman had left the store so I went to go purchase my cards, right as I gave my money to the cashier, she walks up behind me watching me buy my 100 dollars worth of Yu-GI-Oh cards (this isn't a normal thing to do). She said nothing though and I left before she went to go buy her items so I didn't have to see the look on her face when she realized. There is no doubt in my mind that once she realized she was 100 dollars short, she would make the assumption it was the kid in front of her in line who spent 100 on cards.

confession,I found my Brothers suicide note on Reddit and didn't tell anyone.Remorse (self.confession),"Throwaway account. [REMORSE] When I was around 14 or 15 I found my older brothers Reddit account because of a secret santa package that got sent to us. I of course wanted to snoop onto his account so I checked his history, and found all of his posts for the past month had been been to /r/depression One post mentioned how my family, including me, were out of town due to me playing sports. That was the night he said he would finally commit suicide. He mentioned either pills or knives and it still haunts me to this day. I was obscenely scared when I found this post, and was home alone and vowed to myself to never let anyone know that I found this. To this day, my parents do not know, and have tried to keep me in the dark about his struggles with mental health as much as they can, and my brother most definitely does not know. The only person who knows is my now long term girlfriend, and now you guys. I feel awful for never telling anyone in my family, and I feel like this has taken a toll on my own mental health, which in itself is not in a good state at all. I just want to thank whoever dissuaded my brother from commiting suicide that day.

confession,I’ve intentionally NOT cleaned our house for the past year (self.confession),"My husband claims to be a germaphobe, but lives like a slob. We separated (but never officially divorced) in 2020. I truly loved living alone with my pets, but am admittedly not the best housekeeper. Laundry is always piled up and the dishes don’t get washed until I can actually fill the dishwasher. I don’t sweep/mop as often as I should, but will make a generous effort if expecting company. So back in 2022 we reconnected and rekindled our relationship, and decided to move back in together. His OCD (which I have recently learned to call it) is extremely frustrating. He MUST wash or sanitize his hands after touching anything that’s been on the floor, money, his wallet, etc. I am required to do the same. Any piece of clothing that has been worn outside of the bedroom (ie. his “safe space”) even if only for an hour, has to go immediately into the laundry. He hasn’t had a legit job in over a year. Some under-the-table work for a while, started two different server jobs and was fired within a few weeks. I work full time and pay at least 90% of the bills (this was still the case before we split). So for the past year I decided that if he is gonna be a SAHH I’m not going to do the housework. Guys, our house is disgraceful and I’d be mortified if anyone came to visit. The floors haven’t been cleaned in months. The garbage is overflowing before it gets taken out. Last week we got a notice in the mail about our unkempt lawn. I cave in and clean the bathroom when he leaves skid marks in the toilet or when the sink or shower starts looking gross but I legitimately can’t tell if he just doesn’t notice these things, doesn’t care, or just knows that eventually I’ll take care of them so he won’t have to.",Tracyjeanbitch,https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1hoawin/ive_intentionally_not_cleaned_our_house_for_the/

confession,"For three years, I switched my partner's tea in the morning because I couldn't deal with his fake snobbery.Light (self.confession)","When my ex and I started dating, I used to make him a morning cup of tea as a cute gesture and it stuck for the three years that we were together. It's a nice small thing you can do to make someone's day and and it's a nice way to get to know how someone likes things doing. So, my morning tea used to be any old teabag (Yorkshire tea if it was on offer), a splash of milk, and the first cup always had a teaspoon of sugar; every cup after was just tea and milk. My ex however had to have a very specific ritual: Thompsons Punjana tea, a teaspoon of milk and absolutely no sugar. He was adamant that he could tell in a heartbeat when his morning cup of tea and at the age of 33, he's never liked any other tea other than Fortnum & Mason's Royal Blend. So, in the beginning when he would stay at mine, I entertained this notion and used to make his morning tea the way he liked: Thompsons Punjana tea, a teaspoon of milk and absolutely no sugar. He would always thank me and tell me that I make the best cups of tea and it was nice, three times a week didn't kill me and it was a sweet gesture. Fast forward three months when he would spend nearly everyday of the week at mine (but not moved in), he was very demanding of his morning ritual and being a student, I couldn't keep affording to buy that brand of tea; besides, what was wrong with PG tips or any non-branded supermarket tea? Tea is tea after all. So, I used to always make his cup of tea with any tea bag, a teaspoon of milk and no sugar. I was always sure to only make it when he was in the shower or still in bed so he could never catch me out and initially, he was dubious and was always asking to make sure it was Thompsons Punjana tea (he used to call it by it's full name to emphasise how good it was). after a few trials of different teas, I finally found that sweet point where he couldn't taste the difference. I would drink it with him and as he sipped, would go on about how you can taste the quality and that there is really no other tea like it. When we moved in with each other, it was a lot harder to disguise the fact that I was keeping the same box of tea and just filling it with regular tea bags so I had to be a bit more clever. At the time, I was studying at college so I was in control of weekly food shops and only really wanted to go twice a week to minimise costs so we had more to spend on meals out. I used to buy one bag of his tea and two bags of mine a week and kept them in the drinks cupboard. When it came to making his in the morning, I would take one of his teabags and put it in my pocket, giving him one of mine instead and I used to give my tutors at college his tea to drink during the day. He would always comment that I run out quicker of my tea bags because of the quality and that with Punjana, one bag is enough for a considerable amount of time; little did he know. This went on for a couple of years and I never told anyone about it out of fear that he would find out, as after all, he really couldn't tell so why ruin the fun? It was saving me money and it was sort of amusing. I never let him make a cup of tea unless I was away so he never really had to find out. After we split up, we remained good friends and I've spent some time with him too in our old flat. Every time I visit, he always asks me to make a cup of tea the way I used to for old times sake because everyone he's been with or dated after me can never ""make it taste the way I did"". He even says that when he makes it himself with Punjana that he could never make it taste right and that I was some sort of special tea maker. I still haven't told him. This is a long post about tea so the TLDR: ex used to play on that he was very fussy with tea, I switched his morning cup to a considerably cheaper tea bag and he could never tell the difference and still can't.",evrrtt,https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/950fmp/for_three_years_i_switched_my_partners_tea_in_the/

I do feel a tinge guilty about how I reacted, so I appreciate you guys here giving nothing but love. Edit 2: Wow was not expecting this to blow up. For those of you saying I need help, trust me I get that. I was in a very dark place at the time. And I was VERY drunk while doing all of this. I ended up going to rehab and am happily sober now. My life has IMMENSELY changed for the better and I handle things way better now! Edit 3: For those of you wondering why I “let the ex off easy”- honestly I should have guessed he wasn’t that into me. I just wanted him bad and deep down knew he was using me for a place to stay/food/my car/etc. I got myself into that situation. It was a really rough time and I had literally 0 self respect. What really broke my heart was my best friend betraying me like that. I did kick the ex out and he was homeless/without a car/etc so he didn’t get off easy that’s for sure. But at the same time the pain from him cheating was absolutely nothing compared to the realization that I lost my best friend. Edit 4: also I realize my title was very confusing and long winded lol.

Last night my friend and I went to a concert an hour away. We got there early and decided to get something to eat. We shared some spicy Korean fried chicken and a panini. We get to the concert, and about an hour in… I thought the smell (a straight up sausage and bell peppers smell) was my friend burping or something?? a little while later, the smell comes again. I’m confused. we were talking, she didn’t burp, so I’m like, ok someone else around is probably burping or literally eating bell peppers LMAO. The smell was so random and brief, but so consuming. Time passes, the smell appears once more, she says something along the lines of “I keep smelling bell peppers” and I’m like “oh my god me too???” We had a laugh when we were able to finally hear one another leaving the theater, and head home. All is well. Writing this now, the day after. The smell was me. I just farted, and yea. I was shocked lmao. Spicy food can upset my stomach sometimes, and tbh I don’t think I even fully noticed I was slipping out farts at the function because I was so overwhelmed, and when I did discreetly let one out I did not imagine it was that smell somehow?? 😭 So yea.

I do not have a “loose butthole” 😌 I was not thinking clearly bc I was overstimulated. when I tell you I truly was sooooo sure it could not be me producing the smell bc it didn’t even smell like a fart. my brain was just dissociated so I wasn’t putting 2 and 2 together that the smell was me, which sounds dumb, I’m aware, but it’s what happened lmao. I knew I was farting, it was just an afterthought. Do you really remember every time you fart? I know bell peppers aren’t spicy, I never said they were. I said the fried chicken I ate was. I didn’t even eat bell peppers. I have no idea how my fart smelled like that The smarty farties who are being bummers in the communal fart chat, I hope you go to fart and it’s poop.

confession,I lied to a blind neighbor and told him I moved away (self.confession),"Many years ago, I was standing on one of my balconies when a taxi driver was obnoxiously blowing his horn out front and yelling for a blind man to ""walk toward my voice"" from his own townhouse.

I made the mistake of giving the blind neighbor my phone number so that I could give him a ride in the future. Then the phone calls came... and never stopped. And when I gave him a ride, he would ask for various detours. I'm very calculated by nature, if he had told me beforehand where he wanted to go, it would be cool, but no... we'd be driving along and he'd throw in 2 - 3 extra places on each ride. And it came to be every day that he wanted rides... and he'd even call me to remind me to give him a ride, not that was ever late or backed out. Finally I had enough, so I gauged how blind he was. His response was that he was ""blind as a bat"". A week or two after he said that, I told him I had a job interview in the next city.

confession,When I nannied I would read the journal of the mom. (self.confession),"I was only 20 years old and I nannied for this little baby boy. The mom seemed off. She would sleep the entire time I was there in the mornings , or go on three hour runs, or sometimes would just go about her business around the house- completely ignoring me. One time we both sat in the living room while the baby was sleeping in his room- I was reading a book (studying) and she sat there eating McDonald’s and watching her show. She did not say a word to me the entire time. Well, one day when she was out I snooped around and found her journal- I read the whole thing. Then got sad for her- she was so unhappy in her marriage and in life. I ended up working for her for three years and we became close. But that first year was so uncomfortable and awkward. In retrospect, it seems very obvious that she was suffering from post pregnancy depression. Edit: thanks everyone for the positive comments; I honestly was not expecting that- I just wanted to confess. For those of you who think I’m a horrible person for doing this, that’s ok. It was over 15 years ago and it still weighs on my mind that I invaded someone’s privacy. I felt bad about it then which is why I tried to repay by helping, but yes I did invade someone’s privacy and that’s not cool, I’m certainly not saying what I did was ok. Hence, the confession... Also, as a 20 year old with no concept of the hardships of having kids I didn’t understand why she was acting the way she was; I get it now.",Alphabetasouper,https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/bd542l/when_i_nannied_i_would_read_the_journal_of_the_mom/
confession,"In the 2nd grade, two women with clipboards sat in on our classroom for a week “just to observe”. They were there, specifically, to observe me. (self.confession)","I’ll (32f) never forgot the time two grown women were introduced to our class as 'observers' for the week—“they’ll be in the back watching me teach for a few days. In order for them to do their job properly, please ignore them! Act like they’re not here.” They sat silently in the back taking notes on their respective clipboards for an hour or so each day. On that Friday, my teacher keeps me back during recess, telling me the two women want to chat/ask me some questions. I was then placed in a chair directly facing them, with my teacher and her aide standing off to the side a few steps behind the duo. Something was up. They then proceed to tell me, delicately, why they’re here. They go on to explain that my teacher knows I’m a good student and so my recent failing test grades don't make sense. They then show examples of me spelling the same words, or doing the same math accurately on previous tests/assignments, yet completely wrong with recent ones. “Have you been failing these tests on purpose?” This was the first time I experienced that heart-beating-out-of-my-chest type feeling. For one, it was TRUE, I was faking it. On top of that, they seemed VERY serious, scary serious, especially to my 8yo self. I, shamefully, admitted that yes, I had been. And when they asked why — well, that answer (the truth) led to my first (non-parental) authoritative-scolding on memory. Simply, I did it because I was jealous of the kids who seemingly got to have a second recess There was group of 20 or so students across the six 2nd grade classrooms who got pulled each week for roughly half the day. One day I saw them playing outside from inside the classroom. They appeared to be having soo much fun, and I wanted in on the fun. So I asked one of them how they got put into that group and was told, “because I’m bad at spelling and math”. Ugh, my two strongest subjects. What am I ever to do? Dumb myself down, of course! To become one of them, I had to act like them, think like them, test like them. After our lil’ interview sesh, my failed attempt at manipulation - whatever you wanna call it - was never discussed of again. My parents never questioned me about it (to this day I don’t know what they know/were told, if anything at all), my peers never knew about it, and I never told a soul. Those women scared the living daylights out of me.",PerizzHilton,https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1gucna0/in_the_2nd_grade_two_women_with_clipboards_sat_in/
confession,I lied on my resume and the company that made an offer noticed.... (self.confession),"I often fudge on how much I know of a thing. Maybe I worked with the software for a few weeks 3 years ago and used if just fine. They want expert level - I say I'm expert. I get the job and all I do is login, pull data, and log out. Less than I did 3 years ago. (UPDATE AT THE BOTTOM) 99% of the time, as a contractor, I don't even do what they hired me for. I do a job that's beneath me. Here's what they do: Let's call them a fake name of ""ABC Fargo"" or ""XYZ Bank America"" ""ABC Fargo"" company has a need for someone to create spreadsheets and process maps documenting a network topology. They've had flakes in the role before - technical people who have no interpersonal skills and no business acumen, they work slow, don't understand the big picture, they don't keep people updated, etc. Maybe paying them $45/hr So they hire me, an IT PROJECT MANAGER with a background 20+ years ago as a Data Network Engineer. Paying me $90/hr giving me the title of Applications Program Manager with a fancy job description with a bunch of shit I won't be doing, but ONE LINE in there that says I need to know how to document a network. They figure they will aim high, pay high, just so they can be sure to get someone that can work well with other departments to gather the information, keep everything on schedule, and not drop out of sight, and do clean efficient work. They don't care about my career and that this job is a step backwards, and when I go to get my next job as a Project or Program Manager, it makes me look bad if I say what I was REALLY doing. They figure the pay is so high, I'm working from home, by the time I figure it out, I'll stay for the money - which I do. But my skills don't grow. So yeah, I lie on my resume. Yeah I did extensive and complication project management for ABC Fargo for a year with budget, and tollgates, and scrums, and project plans, and clearing roadblocks. No way I'm going to say I just did spreadsheets and visio diagrams day in and day out for a whole year. This has happened on the last 6 contracts I have worked. They lie, I lie. We're even. So I keep the fancy job description, I make up project accomplishments. Everything on there I know how to do, it's just not 100% honest. So this time, I was finding it hard to find another role since my last contract completed April 2024. So I started fudging the dates so it looked like I did less contracting and stayed places a little longer. Sometimes contracting make you look flakey, but the money is GOOD! Soon as I changed up the dates, I got interview. Literally the next day after I started using the fudged dates. In my experience, that initial resume never seems to make it to HR - they look at the APPLICATION. I never lie on the application. Dates and titles are correct. I leave the job duty stuff though- they can't verify that. I've never been called on it until last week. People are often incompetent and it usually works in my favor. They're not paying much attention in how they do their jobs. I'm posting now because it's all complete and I started yesterday. Here's how it went down: One of the recruiters for the agency was getting on my nerves calling me all day asking for information he could have just put it all in an email at the end of the day. He wanted to to a mock interview and I told him to take a hike, I'm old as fuck and don't need interview help. I think he got offended and decided to try and trip me up. He has never called or emailed me since then - his boss does. (I have an interview to contract for ""EFG Sachs"" I have worked for this agency before at ""XYZ Chaser Banker"" in 2023. So they only need to verify the last contract I had after 2023 right? Nope. Somehow they are verifying EVERYTHING all over again. I get an email from the HR/Background Check person: ""You resume says this, but your application says this."" I was like... Oh shit. It's finally caught up with me. It was a Friday afternoon, so I let it lay and took time to figure it out the weekend. I was prepared to lose the offer, so that made it easy to be confident about my response. Which was plainly and simply: ""I recently had my resume professionally rewritten and it looks like I didn't double-check the dates. Everything on the application is correct and verifiable."" No apology, no long-winded explanation. They accepted that and everything moved forward with them verifying. Whether they thought I was lying, I don't care. I got an email a few days later: ""Background check complete."" All of a sudden, last Friday, I get an email: ""Background check reopened."" (gaslighting language, right?) I was like... what is it now? I know the application was correct. Maybe they escalated to a manager about the resume and don't want to take a chance and upset their client ""MNO Sachs"". Because if ""MNO"" wants to take me permanent as an employee, they will do their own verification and the agency would be on the hook. Turns out, two of my old positions could not be verified - 1 wasn't answering and the other had sold and merged with another firm. So I sent them W2s for those two roles. See? That's why I don't lie on the application. SIDE NOTE: They wanted me to either send pay stubs or W2s or give them access to my taxes. If they got access to my taxes, they'd see the times I was working for two companies at the same time! When I worked for them and ""ABC Fargo"" remote, I also worked remote for another company remote. It was the tail end of COVID and I needed to make up for the times I had no contract. But I wasn't doing the work I was hired for, I was doing dumb work that wasn't challenging, so I worked two 8-5s at once - succeeding at both. So use caution when showing them your taxes - they get to see EVERYTHING that's not their business. The IRS sends your transcripts directly to them!!! Total invasion of privacy. So I won out on the application verification and started work yesterday (2 days in the office 3 at home - which leaves me room to do another contract, as I expect I have been lied to on this one as well). I've been out of work since April and today is my last unemployment filing - There's only $57.65 left of my claim. 99% of the time, you won't get caught. But be prepared for that one time. I'm 50+ and this is the first time I ever got called on it, and I firmly believe I was targeted because I told the dude to chill. I've even lied about a degree out of frustration and it got me the interview. If I can interview, I'll get an offer. Do what you have to do to get that interview - don't take it too far and lie completely - fudge the dates and the titles and the duties. Don't straight out lie about working somewhere you didn't, or put duties you have no idea how to perform. Everything on my resume I can do. TIPS If it's been a while, look at some YouTube training to get back up to speed or be able to discuss intelligently. Jot down keywords and definitions on your printed job description. Always print out the JD and take notes on it - and have cliff notes as well. Include buzz words like business partners, team members. Google Interview buzzwords and jot them down on the JD or on sticky notes somewhere you can glance at them during your video interview. Ace the interview by acting as though you already work for the company, you're just going to be working with a different department. Introduce yourself, ask them about how you can help, what they need you to do,. Say we and our and us and shit like that. Trick them into it. Use their names (jot them down doofus - I'm bad at names too). ""You know, James mentioned earlier that he'd had a hard time getting the last person in the role to respond to emails. I understand what that can mean to you being able to complete your part of the work. I am mindful that my part affects someone else's work. But if you aren't getting what you need, please let me know, and I hope I can do the same. I value my team and don't mind having a tough conversation and hitting the reset button. Tell me, Sarah (manager), what are you most proud about when it comes to your team?"" ""Mark, you work closely with this role and you shared what you would need from me if I were to join the team (see how I did that?). What are some things you don't want to see? (They LOVE this! They'll say: ""Not double-checking the reports, not responding in time for weekly reports, not admitting when something is not understood, etc."") Just be relaxed and conduct yourself like you're in a conference call to work on a special project for a company you already work for. Tell them about you, ask about them, ask about the work. It will make you seem like part of the team, not some nervous weirdo acting like you're from Mars. Oh - one last thing. ""If I don't know something, I'll say I don't know, but I can find out and get back to you by end of business. Or let's set up a meeting and find out together and come back and let the team know"" No one should ever just say I don't know and leave it at that. They were asking me some word and acronym definitions, and on one of them I was like: ""I know about the subject, but I may not know the formal terms you're using, so let me give you my best guess. Risk control is different from risk mitigation in this way: ""Blah, blah... is that what you were looking for? If I were on the team and someone asked me that, I'd give my best answer and tell them I'd check it out more and follow up by a specific time."" I don't know all the answers, but I know how to find them - that's the key. Well, I know it's a novel, but I hope it helps... UPDATE: People are DMing me asking about my career path and how I chose it. I just started with a job and based on what I liked most, I grew that part and sought a job doing more of what I liked. In 1994 I worked as a staffing manager getting people temporary jobs - making $8.75/hr and placing people making $10+. We had to test them on software. A lot of people were great but didn't know the software, so I trained them on the side without permission and wrote some procedures/cheat sheet they could take on the job - they all got offered perm jobs - just needed a chance. I liked training, so I went after a job training and eventually got one. I lied on my resume to say I did training as a regular part of my job - a little fudge. I was training network engineers on software, then graduated to training how to engineer a piece of equipment - I went from $18,200 to $35k/yr with no degree. Then I learned how much engineers made and since I could train someone how to engineer, I took a job as a network engineer because of the money. When I was a network engineer, I worked with project managers a lot. So, I looked for jobs project managing network projects. I had never done project management as a role, but I had seen it done over and over. So I lied on my resume and said that I had done project management. I then studied project management and got certificates and then got a Jr. Project Management job. September 11th hit and I was laid off. I created a shitty web site to advertise my training that I developed and became self employed. The training was for people who had gotten jobs but didn't know how to use software. I volunteer at an after school program that tutors elementary kids and they have a computer lab. The founder let me use it on the weekends. Which is when working people can come in to train. The city sent about 400 people over the course of a year into 2002. Long story short (I am capable) people kept asking me to do a web site for them. So I taught myself web development and coding. I already knew database/SQL and command line from my training and engineering roles. Web sites got easier for people to do themselves with Wix and more small businesses shifted to free pages on Facebook. Originally, Facebook did not allow businesses. So as my 15 year web business died, I saw a technical writer job in 2017 at a bank and became a technical writer - having written documentation in one form or another all my previous roles. I wrote policies and procedure documentation for everything and often came in contact with risk, compliance, audit. You have to keep your eyes open and not be that dumb person that only knows their own job and likes saying ""I don't know, that's not my department."" From 2017 to now I have accepted roles with the most money ($75-90)/hr that I can get hired for. I have been Project Manager and Program Manager for IT and Risk, I have been Documentation Manager - I pursue Enterprise IT roles because IT pays more than Operations. The job I started a couple days ago bounces me back down to Technical Writer, but in the job description and interview I learned this is a new department. This means I will have an opportunity in the next year to be back in Program management. I'm contract with a lot of experience, so my pay is the same as my IT and I work remote 3 days a week. (I prefer full remote) There are so many lies about job descriptions, I don't chase some pie in the sky career. I need money. I am 54 years on come June and have had great experiences but mostly terrible job experiences - I am still in touch with my Instructor and Network Engineering pals (co-workers and students) from 1997-2001 - best jobs I've ever had. Nowadays 80% is co-worker drama/politics and 20% is actual work.

Whenever a middle aged woman, who clearly looks older than 21, purchases alcohol from me, I intentionally ask them to show me their ID.

confession,I plagiarised my entire dissertation and I got caught. (self.confession),"It just felt too big, too nebulous. I had no idea where to start. I kept putting it off and putting it off again, with no idea of what to do. I could have asked for help, but I didn't. How pathetic, I thought - every other student can manage to write one, but you need help? Just fucking put your head down and do it. But I didn't. With 24 hours to go, I had nothing. So I found a dissertation on Google, and I went through and changed it enough that I thought I could get away with it. I didn't. I have a hearing in a few days, and I can't see any likely outcome other than being kicked out with no degree. I haven't told anybody, besides a nice woman on the phone from Samaritans, because I didn't know who else to call. She didn't seem to know what to say though, and I can't blame her. What is there to say? You fucking idiot? How did you not ask anyone for help at any stage? Why are you the only person who can't fucking write their own dissertation? I'm so ashamed. So so ashamed. I can't tell my friends. Students have fun at university, but I feel as though there is an unspoken contract that everyone can do so because they are all working hard. I have broken my contract, and I cannot admit it. This shame pales in comparison to the shame I feel regarding my parents. I am dreading telling them more than anything. They have been nothing but supportive my entire life. They are wondeful people. They have given me so much help, sacrificed so much for me to get a good education, and I have spat in their faces.

confession,"I stole my friend's folder in 3rd grade, and looking back I deserved to get sent to a mental hospital for what I did. (self.confession)","A little backstory to showcase little me. My parents divorced in second grade and something snapped inside of me. Every minor inconvenience in my life became worthy of a tantrum. Screaming at my parents telling them I hate them. Threatening to jump out of Windows. Once the cops even came to my house because I screamed so often my neighbors thought I was being abused. One day in third grade, I don't remember why, I snuck under my desk and into the backpack of the girl sitting across from me. I took her folder and put it in my bag. It was towards the end of class and she told our teacher who asked me to return it. I went into a rage screaming that I didn't steal it, and how dare she accuse me. I gripped my desk, and a security guard and my vice principal carried me out of my class as I kicked and screamed. I was sent to the principals office, where I kept screaming how I hated life, and I wanted to die, and I wanted my parents to die. My parents were called, and I was taken to a hospital where I spent the night, then the next morning I was carried, kicking and screaming into an ambulance. I remember my mom sitting there crying as I screamed every curse word I knew at her saying it was her fault, and I was going to pee myself if they didnt let me out. My time at the hospital they took me to was a blur, and when I was released I would be in therapy up until I graduated. I've always for some reason felt the need to defend myself saying it wasn't my fault and blaming everyone for freaking out on me. But I'm finally ready to say it. I stole her folder, and I was the one responsible for everything that happened after. Not my parents. Not the school. Not my classmate. I did it, and it feels so amazing to finally say it.

confession,Was naked at my friends party for his kid high on morphine (self.confession),"In my late 20s and early 30s, I started making good money as a financial advisor, and it kinda led me into a bad crowd where we were drinking, doing blow, and it’s when I first got introduced to morphine. All while this happened, I started becoming more distant from my best friend, I’ll call him Ben. Anyways, Ben invites me to his 4-year-old daughter’s birthday party at his house. It was kinda an attempt to patch things up between us. The week I had was super long and stressful, and I had forgotten all about the party until I got a reminder from my phone. I was already with my other friends doing our usual thing when my buddy Chad got this new bottle of solution you take orally. I’d never tried it before, and nothing happened. I looked it up, and it said it was supposed to work in an hour, but nothing happened, so I assumed it was a dud. I Uber to Ben’s birthday party because I didn’t want to drive just in case it would affect me. As soon as I get to his house, it starts to creep up on me, and I’m feeling nice and relaxed, music sounds amazing, all that stuff. I had to go take a shit because it’s a common thing that happens to me when I take morphine. When I’m sitting on the toilet, that’s when it hits me like I got hit by a bus. My mouth is as dry as the fucking desert, my whole body is so nice and relaxed times 10. I’m not going to lie, it felt fucking amazing. In my head, I kept saying, “this is amazing, this is amazing,” over and over and over. I remember slumping the fuck over on the toilet and landing face-first on the bathroom floor. I don’t know how long I was lying there, but Ben’s wife knocks on the door and asked if I’m ok. I tell her I’m fine, but even saying it, I sound like an actual retard. I remember I’ve been in here for a while now, and it looks suspicious asf. My whole body feels heavy as shit, and I just want to lay down and enjoy my high. I try to stand up, but my legs are shaking like crazy, and it feels like I’m 2000 pounds. I manage to open the door after what felt like hours fumbling with the lock. I walk into the main room where everyone’s at. I remember the look of absolute horror on everyone’s face—Ben’s face, his wife’s, his parents, everybody. Me being high asf, I say, “What?” Ben says, “Pull your pants up, WTF are you doing?” I look down, and my dick is out. One of the little kids notices and just screams at the top of her lungs. Me being absolutely blasted, I say, “Shut up, you ole bitch” to a literal 5-year-old. I don’t really remember much after that. I just remember Ben taking me home, me begging him to take me to McDonald’s like a child and whining and crying when he didn’t, and him lecturing me about how much I changed and how much of a degenerate I’ve become. I feel absolutely horrible about ruining that girl’s birthday party, possibly traumatizing a bunch of kids, and having my best friend have to take care of me on a day he was supposed to remember fondly. I’m going to quit all drugs, try to make more meaningful relationships. I’ve apologized to Ben, but obviously, he doesn’t want to talk to me, which I understand.

We went dumpster diving at an old business park. We didn’t find fort worthy material. What we did find were garbage bags full of lottery tickets. Of course we skated away with them every bag to his garage. All the lotto tickets were winners. But we started noticing some were not punched with a hole. We went through thousands of tickets and 1 out of every 200-300 were not holed. We somehow convinced his dad to turn them into a local gas station for us. I remember his dad being kind of excited about it. He was quite a character. We went back to the same dumpster two more times, the third time. Padlock. I think we both walked away with $1000+ that summer. New skateboards are totally rad. UPDATE: My previously mentioned “buddy” saw this, recognized the story. And reconnected after 20+ years.

I walk up and i was like “ oh shit, shes alot less attractive than in her pics , but im already here and went thru this much shit to get here so fuck it why not. We do the thang while on the floor and two days later i got ringworm on my ass cheek. I also neglected to tell her i was a virgin till i was done smashing. Havent told anyone except my close guy friends that story. Edit!

confession,I am accidentally my son’s ghostwriter.Light (self.confession),"My 6th grade son had a school assignment last semester to write a poem. He was struggling as he’s not the least bit interested. Since I was a child I had always wanted to be a writer. I spent 5mins and wrote a quick (dumb to me) poem for him to turn in. Unbeknownst to me his teacher submitted it to a poetry contest which he won, and it’s now going to be published in the middle school’s Anthology.",megatronrex,https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/aioucl/i_am_accidentally_my_sons_ghostwriter/
confession,I made my brother think he has alopecia for the last fifteen years. (self.confession),"This is probably the pettiest thing I have ever done, and I regret it to this day. When I was fifteen years old, I got my first job and started to have some money of my own. I used my money to spoil myself and purchased nicer thing like clothes, shoes, makeup and salon brand shampoo. My brother used to sneak into my bathroom and constantly steal my nice shampoo. He would use them and most of the time he would leave them open in the bathtub. This would result in the rest of the shampoo going down the drain and leave me with empty containers. This drove me completely insane and I hated him for taking my things. I tried to speak with my parents about this, but they told me that I should just learn to share. One day I went out and purchased hair removal cream. I mixed this into my shampoo bottle and left it in my bathroom. I gave him a verbal warning not to use my newly purchased bottle, but he stole it again anyway. Over the next few days his hair slowly started to fall out and small bald patches started to appear. Seeing what I had done I immediately emptied the remaining shampoo. I felt terrible and I truly didn’t think it would have as a dramatic effect as it did. My mother took him to the doctor to get check out and they diagnosed him with Alopecia. He than had to start using this special and terrible smelling shampoo to combat this. His hair did grow back but I just recently found out that he is still using the shampoo in order to prevent another Alopecia flair up. It has been 15 years now and I have never told my brother that I caused him to lose his hair. Edit: Some people are asking why I let this go on for 15 years. I honestly had no idea that he was still using the shampoo and just assumed he stopped at some point or that the doctor had told him he didn’t have alopecia. I just helped him move over the weekend and found a fresh bottle of the shampoo in his bathroom. I completely forgot about this until now. Edit 2: He lived in the basement in the mother in law suite. So it did take a lot of effort for him to come in my second floor private bathroom to steal my shampoo and conditioner. Not trying to defend my poor decision but he didn’t just happen to use it by mistake. I didn’t just leave my things lying around.",Brightside256,https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/d87cfu/i_made_my_brother_think_he_has_alopecia_for_the/
confession,I lie about having my university degree and it got me a great job (self.confession),"I went to an Ivey league university in Ontario Canada right after high school. My marks weren't great but they were good enough to squeeze me in. I spent most of my time in University partying rather than studying but still managed to pass all of my first year classes. In my second year I skipped a lot of classes and was very lazy with the course work. My marks were terrible and I failed a couple of my courses. In my third year about half way through I dropped out and got a job landscaping. I did that for a year when I realized it really sucked and I began to regret not trying harder while I was in school. I figured I would apply to jobs that would normally require the degree that I would have gotten. I had spent the few years in school I was easy enough to make the timeline on my resume make sense and although I dropped out I had a decent knowledge of the area. The field I was attempting to enter is difficult start out in and it took a few months of sending applications to get an interview. The company I got an interview with (my now current employer) is an internationally recognized name in the energy sector. I was extremely surprised to get my interview. One of the documentation requirements was university transcripts and with an hour or two in photoshop I had my proof of graduation. I sent in the papers with the other required information and never heard anything back describing any problems with my records. I ended up going through three interviews in the process and received a position. I have have now been working with this company for almost 5 years. They provided all the necessary job training and nobody has ever questioned my education. I entered with a starting salary of $72,500 CDN and received annual raises. Upon hiring me I was told that the management staff was quite impressed with me through the hiring process and that they usually only hire applicants with minimum requirement of a Masters Degree. I basically shit my pants everyday while in the interview/training process but now I don't really think about it ever. I didn't tell me university friends I faked having my degree. The only people that know I did this are my parents. Thanks for reading !",constantsuit,https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/bgi6ly/i_lie_about_having_my_university_degree_and_it/
confession,I pretended I was selling something on Craigslist and got two strangers to meet awkwardlyLight (self.confession),"Years ago I made a new email address and got two potential buyers for a playstation that I was pretending to sell. I confirmed a date and time with both of them. Decided on the mall near a certain store. I asked what they'd be wearing so I could find them. I gave them each other's description for myself, and then went and hung out. One walked up to the other. You could tell there was an immediate confusion. They started arguing over who had what. You could see them get pissed once they realized what happened and wasted their time. They both stormed off on their phones. Sure enough, I got angry emails from both of them lol I feel kind of bad about it, but it was a funny interaction to witness.",scarfacesaints,https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/9ivxs6/i_pretended_i_was_selling_something_on_craigslist/
confession,When I was a server I threw a customers phone into a trash compactor (self.confession),"I had just started serving tables at a restaurant, and I was working my first super busy brunch shift. I had 6+ tables and I’m not gonna lie, I had a tough time running all the mimosas that my tables were ordering. I could tell that one table of all women were getting abnormally angry about their drinks taking a while. I apologized for the delay and made a joke about it being an especially busy shift. I offered them a round of drinks on me to smooth the situation over. When I walked away, one lady murmured under her breath that I was an “incompetent cunt”. Let’s stop there, its common for people to treat servers like shit, but this was the first time I ever had experienced being spoken to like I was garbage. I shook it off and continued to be nice to them, but it only got worse from there. They started to laugh at me, and shit talk me to one another. They told me that my future career looked pretty bleak, considering I couldn’t even serve tables, “honey, even a toddler can deliver drinks”. When I took their order for food, one woman REFUSED to speak to me. She just stared at me while her friend ordered for her. By now I am pissed. I asked her why she felt the need to have her friend order for her? She laughed in my face, looked down at the menu, and said because I was a dumb little bitch. Due to the fact I was at work, I couldn’t argue or tell her to eat shit for treating me like I was a dog, if I did my boss would have fired me. They ended up stiffing me on their 200 dollar check. Once they left, I realized the woman that gave me so much shit had left her phone. I took it and went out the back door to smoke a cigarette and try to calm down, who the hell did that women think she is? So I promptly turned off her phone, threw it in the trash compactor, and turned it on. She came back minutes later and asked multiple staff members if we found it, I told her that I didn’t see it when I bussed the table, and that I would call her if it turned up. I never told anyone but I never regretted doing it. When you treat people like shit, expect shitty things to happen to you Edit #1. Thanks for my first ever metal kind stranger! Edit #2. I should have clarified that they stiffed me, as in they didn’t tip me. They did pay their bill before they bounced Lastly, I’ve been in the service industry for a hot minute and I’ve only experienced this level of disrespect twice. Whether you believe it or not, some people actually think they have the right to talk to servers like this and many restaurants dgaf",dump_poon,https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/db35ff/when_i_was_a_server_i_threw_a_customers_phone/
confession,Our first daughter was raped at 14 and we raised the baby as our own child. Our first daughter committed suicide and we carried on raising the baby. My grandchild thinks we're her parents and I cant bring myself to tell her the truth even nowRemorse (self.confession),"This is a lengthy confession. I'm sorry if you don't like reading long posts you can skip to the end if you want. Our first daughter was raped when she was 14. It destroyed her childhood and flipped our lives upside down. You always assume if you bring your child up right and take care of them nothing bad will happen, but something bad just happened anyway and there was nothing we could do afterwards to make what happened right. The man who did it got sent to jail eventually, but our daughter was never the same again. Counseling never brought her smile back, nothing seemed to work. She seemed so cold and emotionally dead from there onward and we tried so hard to connect back with her but nobody could. She was an island and didn't want to talk to anyone about anything. We as parents blamed ourselves for this. We ended up pulling our daughter out of school to home school her because her attendance was very bad and she suffered night terrors which kept her awake some nights. It was probably a bad decision and over protective parenting, but we wanted to protect her and felt a regular school wasn't a safe environment for her at the time. As if the situation could be any worse we found out our daughter was pregnant with the rapists child. We tried to suggest an abortion because of her age and the situation, but she didn't want to. Our daughter refused to abort the pregnancy, so we kept her out of school to give birth to the baby. We raised the child as our 2nd daughter to give our 1st daughter the life she was robbed. We just wanted her to enjoy her life and told her we'd raise the baby for her as her sibling and she agreed to this. It was partly out of fear of what the neighborhood would think, and partly out of wanting our daughter to continue having a normal teenage life. It wasn't ideal, but things worked for a time and our daughter got to see her daughter whenever she wanted, which was better than giving the baby up to adoption. Things didn't last this way for long though as our daughter's mental health started to deteriorate. When our first daughter started to become heavily suicidal. There was nothing we could do because every time we tried to get closer to her she'd push us away worse than before. She was hospitalized several times for suicide attempts until she succeeded in committing suicide. This destroyed us. At first we hated the baby and blamed it. We blamed it for the death of our daughter and were in denial it was our fault. Eventually though we realized we were to blame, not the child who was brought into the world by no fault of their own. We'd focused for so long on the fact it was half of the rapist's child, that we'd overlooked the fact it was also half of our daughter. It took a lot of time to come to this conclusion, but we'd always looked after the baby out of respect to our daughter. The thought of giving it up to adoption went through my mind several times, but I knew my daughter didn't want this and so did my wife. We gave her daughter, our daughter the best life we could. We bought her anything she could ever want, took her to concerts and on holidays. We even sent her to a private school despite the extra expense with hopes that she will become successful in life and live the life our daughter never got to live. She is home right now and whenever she hugs me or my wife and says: ""I love you mom/dad"" it hurts like a dagger through our hearts. I always look towards my wife every time our daughter says it. She finds it as painful as I do and I can tell by the look in her eyes. It's not that we don't love her, it's that her entire life is being lived believing a lie. We're actually her grandparents and she has no idea of this. She's never asked if we're really her true parents because obviously she has never had a reason too. Part of me though believes lying by omission is still lying though. We've never told her the truth about her sister being her mother. She knows her sister committed suicide, but she is too young to remember her. I feel as though we're protecting her from being damaged and hurt by keeping her oblivious to all of this. Maybe I'm just being selfish, maybe my wife is too. We just don't want to see her suffer. The thought of her not being strong enough to hear the truth scares me the most. I know I shouldn't compare her to my other daughter, but I would never forgive myself if she committed suicide too after learning the truth. I cannot lose both of them, I can't survive another loss like this. The whole situation is soul crushing. The only person I can talk to is my wife. It feels like some massive thing nobody else can ever know. Not even our parents know the truth.",SevereUnderstanding4,https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/9arjfb/our_first_daughter_was_raped_at_14_and_we_raised/

confession,"After my bike was locked by campus police for being illegally parked, I damaged property to get my bike free and get out of a ticketLight (self.confession)","When I was in college, I illegally parked my bike onto a sign post. I did this because all the bike slots were overflowing everyday and there just wan't enough parking for all the students. So I locked it to a nearby sign post. I can't remember what it said, probably 'no parking' lol. Anyways, I locked it, went to class, and when I came out it had a lock on it from the campus police along with a ticket. It was one of those heavy duty U-shaped metal bar locks. I walked home that day, then later at night when nobody was around, I went back to my bike, worked the sign post out of the ground, which was compact crushed stone, and got my bike free. The lock was still on my frame, but I could ride it. I lay the sign on the ground, rode back home, then the next day I borrowed a stone wheel attachment for a drill and cut through the lock. It wore down the attachment, but I got out of a $15 ticket.

confession,"I am not really human anymore, due to permanent brain damage. (self.confession)","I had a serious head injury in 2009, it killed me, obviously I was brought back, lots of freaky stuff happened at the time, as one would expect from serious permanent brain damage. I was in hospital for three days not expected to leave alive, but I did. I have permanent amnesia. I lost every personal memory I had, I don’t even remember my mother’s face, hell I didn’t recognise my own face. Anything before 2009 is sketchy at best. It took five years to come to terms with the new reality, and the realisation that I had lost the ability to feel fear due to my amygdala being permanently damaged. I had lost the emotional connection with my now ex-wife. Losing an emotion has left me feeling that I am no longer human. A person who can’t feel fear is a monster. There are less limits on doing anything, which is not as good as it sounds. Physically I am human, but losing that emotion has made the other emotions I have left, heightened. Love is extreme, but so is anger, I take great efforts to avoid hate, because I don’t know how I could stop it. Anger is almost impossibly to come down from. When I am angry I see red, i can hear the blood rushing in my ears, I feel like I am going to explode, and it takes an extreme effort to suppress that rage. I will usually sit quietly gripping a desk, or squeezing my fists, until I can get to a level of control. I hide this rage, no one really knows how volatile I can be. I don’t want people to be afraid of me, but they would be if they knew. [edit] there has been an overwhelming response to my post, and I am working through all the replies.

confession,"I stole from a museum as a child, and I don't mean from the gift shop. (self.confession)","When I was a child (around 7 or 8), I went on a school trip to a museum that had an Ancient Egypt exhibit running. The museum staff allowed the class to look at some old relics, passing them around in a circle. I remember looking at this little greeny/blue coloured figurine of a Goddess with a hippo head. I really liked it, without a second thought I put it in my pocket and took it home with me. I sat at home playing with it, not really understanding the gravity of what I had done. Then we had a big assembly at school. The museum were looking for this figurine as it was not a replica but an actual ancient Egyptian artifact. I remember playing scenarios in my head of how I could give it back without getting caught, but I couldn't see a way out of it. The museum became angrier, the assemblies grew more pressing, letters went home to all parents, parents were called in of 'naughty' children who could have possibly done it. Finally everyone calmed down, they realised they weren't getting it back. I got away with it. The problem is I'm now 31 and I still have the figurine! I couldn't throw it away, it's thousands of years old. I couldn't give it back, I would have been in unbelievable trouble. If I gave it back now, it would look strange that it's turned up after all this time in the same town by someone who went to the same school. I've never told anyone about this figurine, no one else has ever seen it. I have no idea what I'll ever do with it.. but that's my confession, museum theif of an ancient artifact at 7 years old.

When I came to school the next day though the same kid I bought the Pringles from, gave me back the $40 while crying because apparently his mom screamed at him to give it back and now he couldn’t buy candy with it because his mom wouldn’t let him keep it. I held on to that money for a couple days until my mom started looking around and asking if I had seen the money laying around since it wasn’t in her purse, so once I realized how I’d get my ass beat if she found out I hid it under the couch and ‘found’ it about 30 minutes later.

confession,"I destroyed my work project, and I hope I get firedTough Love (self.confession)","This is petty. I don't care. I've worked at a company for two years. In that time, I've gone from an 'incredible asset to the company' to 'babysitter'. I wish I was joking. This company is owned by several people, but managed by a relative to the higher ups. A guy who has never worked for anyone except his Mommy (who owns the company). A guy who is incapable of doing basically anything for himself. Someone who will 'one day' take over the company, who currently can't even figure out Bluetooth. Moron would be a compliment. You think I'm just being harsh on my boss, or exaggerating. I wish. I wish it was just me being dramatic. Last phonecall I had from him was him asking where he was. No, I'm serious. ""Foot, I'm driving. Where am I?"" He asks me to track his phone, find his location, see if I can find a store near him that sells a certain item (that he can't remember the name of the store either, or where it is exactly), and then I am to GPS voice navigate him there using track his phone to tell him when to turn. This is my life. 50+ phone calls a day from this man. ""Foot, did you get my email?"" ""Yes, I responded to it and answered your questions."" ""Oh good. Read it out to me."" Proceed to read the email to him. He is happy. Fast forward two hours. Get a scathing email from him, responding to my reply: ""Foot, why did you email me again when we just talked about this on the phone?! This wastes my time."" I no longer do my regular job. I've been transitioned into this 'Personal Assistant' role, even though I did not want it. At all. To the point I'm currently searching for a new job. The company is bleeding money like someone cut off both of its legs. Boss is supposed to be figuring out why, but the guy can't even pour himself a cup of coffee from the machine we've had for six years. In my day to day, I also assist other departments. I have access to various software. I work alongside multiple managers and assist with their projects as well (when I'm not being asked to identify the brand of socks Boss is wearing so that he can figure out where to buy more, and have me call to 'have them set aside a package for me so I don't have to walk through the store looking for these like an idiot') Based on my observations, I found several problems that are costing us money. Either by purchasing, distribution or just general lack of adaquate price adjustments. Some were serious enough that I even spoke to a different department manager, who was impressed and took me to the CEO to ask if I can be moved to their department to help fix some of the identified problems. CEO is Boss's Mother. I get told that I absolutely am not allowed to transfer. That I am far too valuable as a personal assistant to be shared with other departments. That Boss will handle and oversee the changes that need to be made. Manager and I were stunned. Turns out, Mother wants to step away from the company and wants Boss to run it. That Boss just needs more projects to work on to get a better understanding of how to run the company. Boss gets called in, told that I identified several issues and that Boss needs to get them resolved. Boss gets mad at Mother, telling her he doesn't have time to do that. Mother says she understands, that he is a very busy boy. (Again, I'm not joking. Sitcoms can't even write this kind of shit). Boss later calls me into his office, and tells me that I am to work on fixing all of these issues, but that I'm to give him all my notes, tell him how I fixed it and he will present it to the board. Boss then proceeds to leave for the day, calling me later to ask what kind of mustard was the mustard he liked the most on his deli sandwiches. Then proceeded to lecture me on mustard, because the answer I gave him was obviously not the right kind of mustard and that I need to pay more attention to things like that. I hung up the phone, picked up all my notes on this 'bleeding money' situation / project and shredded them. Oops. Sorry! I'm too much of an idiot to handle doing any type of investigation work into our financial records for the past 5 years. I'm certainly too much of an idiot to notice that your profit margins went from 32% to less than 18.3% on the majority of our products we manufacture, all the while giving our distributors more than 46% discount so that they 'keep coming back for more'. Here is hoping Boss can figure that out, especially considering the layoffs we keep having. Excuse me while I make note of what kind of mustard he prefers on his montreal smoked meat sandwich, which is a much more important use of my time. Because, in the words of Boss: ""Maybe one day you'll be capable, like me, if you keep working at it."" I hope I get fired.

confession,I made my school believe they broke my iPad and made them buy me a new one.Light (self.confession),"My highschool didn’t allow phones/tablets to be on your person throughout the school day, instead they made us all hand our devices in every morning and pick them up at the end of the school day. They provided us with these white cushioned envelope bags to protect them by it really did nothing. Anyway one morning I was rushing to catch the bus and on the way out of my bedroom I decide to throw my iPad onto my bed. But it bounced off, landing face down on the slate tiles. I knew straight away it smashed from the sound, I stood there cursing myself until I had an idea. I grabbed my phone bag and put the broken iPad and shattered glass in it and took it to school. I handed it in acting nonchalant about it and when it came time to pick it up in the afternoon I put my best shocked/sad face on as I opened the bag. I went to the nearest teacher and told her that I found my iPad broken. She took me to the office and eventually to the principal. At first she seen suspicious about the entire thing but when my dad (25 year army veteran) came in to pick me up, he gave her and the entire admin staff a spraying. She originally agreed to pay for it to be repaired but when that couldn’t be done she agreed to buy a replacement model. But the thing is that the ipad was a 2nd gen model and it was 2014 so ended up getting a brand new model as well. I never admitted it to anyone in school out of fear it would eventually lead to the principal finding out. Edit: the teacher didn’t pay for it, the principal used the schools credit card Edit: Jesus Christ guys why would the teacher paid for the ipad! Of course the school paid for it!

confession,I once skunked a bottle of wine given to a bullying manager on my team then gave it to herLight (self.confession),"Many moons ago I was working for a large technology company. It was common practice for managers on the same team to exchange some sort of token holiday gift just before Christmas - something under $20. One of these managers was a very nasty woman who was quietly bullying some of her employees and one of the other managers on our team. We were trying to deal with her through the proper channels but, the holidays sprang up in the meantime. When the holidays came around, I bought a case of a nice red wine that I enjoyed and prepped them all with giftbags. Except one bottle - the bottle for the nasty manager. I took that bottle and spent about two weeks heating the bottle and chilling the bottle by wrapping it in a particularly warm heating pad and standing it on top of my old apartments hot water heater for one or two hours then sticking it in the freezer until the bottle was cold to the touch. My goal was to ruin the wine, turn it to vinegar. The holidays came and I gave my fellow managers their gift wine and we all headed out of the office for a few days for company-wide OOO. When we came back everyone was talking about how wonderful the wine was. Except the nasty manager, who was surprised everyone loved it. She was going on about how nasty it was and how bad it smelled and how she couldn't even drink it. It was intended as a harmless prank but, when she was fired a few days later for bullying people, she exploded and mentioned my ""shitty wine"" in her tirade as she threw things around the office on her way out the door. I felt some degree of pride about that because fuck her for bullying people. [Light]",,https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/9xfbhb/i_once_skunked_a_bottle_of_wine_given_to_a/
confession,I Disabled my Teacher’s Account to avoid a failing grade (self.confession),"When I was 15, I once intentionally logged into my teacher’s workspace three times with the wrong password so her account would get disabled. The goal? To stop her from entering my failing grade. It actually worked, for a little while, at least. She couldn’t log in, and the grade wasn’t recorded immediately. But the next day, she stood in front of the whole class and asked who did it. I just sat there in silence, completely terrified. No way was I confessing. Looking back, I kinda laugh at the situation, but I’m also so glad I kept my mouth shut.

confession,"I locked one of the bathroom stalls at work from the outside on purpose, making it unusable. (self.confession)","Two weeks ago I got incredibly angry at my company for reasons that are not so relevant for this post. In a fit of petty revenge, I locked one of the bathroom stalls in the toilet. These stalls use Indicator latches for locking/unlocking, and have a white/red indicator on the outisde to show if its occupied or not. Normally, these can only be locked/unlocked from the inside, but if the little ""beam"" is balanced vertically before closing the door, it is possible to tip it over by sliding the indicator a bit, locking it from the outside. This is exactly what I did. Anyway, I thought that someone is going to notice this by now, as many people use the toilet, but so far its been locked a full week and nothing changed. There are 3 other stalls, so people can still do their business, so no one is really inconvinienced or harmed by this. My only regret is that I locked the first one in the row, and not the one next to it, because this way, I could poop in peace, knowing that no one will sit in the stall next to mine. I could unlock it from the outside the same way i locked it, but at the moment I am sort of more curious to see when the company will finally do something about it. Update: The stall has been unlocked today, after full 10 days (4 days on weekend) of it being locked. The floor was quite clean so I am assuming it was the cleaning personal that unlocked it. I did not expect this post to blow up so much. You guys really made me laugh with your comments, thanks for that!

confession,"I spent a night in bed with another man, and never told anyone. (self.confession)","When I was like 22, I attended a conference at a hotel. My stay at the hotel was covered by my college, but I drove myself there. Well, the night I had to checkout, there was this massive storm. I was terrified of driving home in it. But I was broke, and couldn't afford to pay for a room on my own. I was trying to work something out at the front desk, and started sobbing. A guy from my college, who I barely knew, saw me crying, and said he was staying another night. He said I could stay with him, as long as I'd be comfortable sharing a bed (his room only had one). Of course I was scared of sharing a bed with a random dude. And I was dating a horrible, jealous, and controlling man child. He'd be furious if he found out. But I was so desperate, so I just went ahead and did it. Looking back at it, I am so lucky that nothing happened. The guy was perfectly respectful. He never once tried to make a move on me, or do something that would make me uncomfortable, for the entire night. And my boyfriend at the time (thankfully my ex now) never found out about it.

confession,"I used to work in a shoe shop and deliberately sold a customers shoes whilst she was trying on shoes, just to make her buy a new pair. (self.confession)","Title says it all. I was 16 and my first job was in a shoe shop. We had one regular awkward woman customer who came in every Saturday afternoon whilst the store was at its busiest and literally asked to try on every pair of shoes in the shop before leaving an hour later without buying anything. I was the new boy and the youngest, so all the other staff always dumped her on me. One day, she was up to her usual Saturday afternoon hobby and an elderly lady, obviously visually impaired handed me a pair of shoes and asked me how much... They were the awkward customers own shoes that the elderly woman had picked from the floor. I quoted her a ridiculously low price and she bought them immediately. Ten minutes later, the awkward customer started shrieking that she couldn’t find her shoes and after complaining to the manager believing they had been stolen by shoplifters. He was having none of it stating it wasn’t the companies fault if customers had their personal property stolen in the store. The woman had to buy a new pair of shoes or leave bare footed. We never saw her again. Edit: Thankyou for all the replies. I would never have believed this posting would generate so much interest as I posted this story over a year ago as a reply on AskReddit and only received 3 replies, lol. To elaborate on the story and answer some of the questions raised; firstly, yes, it is a true story and happened some time over the school summer holiday period of 1984 shortly after I started working at the store. The department I worked in wasn’t exactly the normal shoe shop environment most people are familiar with. I worked in a special department on the lower ground floor of one of the larger branches of a national shoe retailer and this department sold all the reject stock from all the other branches. Stuff such as shop soiled, sun faded stock from window displays, repaired damaged stock, customer returns etc. The stuff that was below the standard that could be sold in the regular departments. All stock we held was displayed on the shop floor on racks so you couldn’t ask for different sizes etc as it was all random stuff. We only displayed the right foot of a pair of shoes and customers had to ask for the left foot of the shoe to try on, and there was a rule that only one pair could be given to one customer to try on for security reasons. We had a major problem with shoplifting and there were only normally two or maximum three members if staff manning the department. It was a hell of a job keeping track of the pairs that were handed to customers to try when the shop floor was busy, and often shoplifters waited till we were all distracted then left without paying. This was before cctv so all we had were our eyes to monitor where paired stock was on the shop floor... The woman I describe as awkward, wasn’t just awkward in the traditional sense, she was totally obnoxious, narcissistic, racist and constantly demanding attention. Her behaviour lost us a lot of stock to shoplifters because she distracted us from watching other paired stock out on the shop floor and she wouldn’t return pairs she didn’t want, just kicked them off in a corner before wandering around looking for the next pair. A couple of weeks before the story, a pair of shoes she had asked to try were stolen because of her doing this and her attitude when we asked her, was that it wasn’t her problem and we deserved to lose stock because we were all Jews (sorry if this is offensive to you but that’s what she said)... Back to the original story, lol, the incident wasn’t premeditated, it was one of those spontaneous ‘fuck you’ opportunities where all rationality temporarily disappears for a moment. The elderly lady handed me the bitch woman’s shoes and that was it, lol. I only asked the elderly lady for either 50p or £1, I can’t remember what, bagged them and the sale went through the till followed by a Thankyou... incidentally, the condition of the bitch woman’s shoes and quality of brand was a lot better than the crap we sold, so the Old Dear got one hell of a bargain... My thoughts immediately afterwards weren’t of satisfaction, they were of ‘Oh Shit’, and I was bricking it, worrying what would happen next, lol. When the shit hit the fan and the manager became involved, I was just glad he was pre-aware of her and had no sympathy of her loss because of her attitude when she previously lost our stock.

confession,I walked into a bank and just robbed it years ago. (self.confession),"Years ago I was in a tough spot. Very tight on money, had a decent job, but with my divorce, mortgage, car payments, child support payments and all other expenses, I only had like $25 to my name in my checking account. I went to the bank and needed $100 in singles (not for a strip club). Went to the bank and they guy in front of me made a big deposit, gave the teller a lot of $20 and other bills to buy mainly $20s. When it was my turn, I asked for 100 single and gave them $100. She counted out 100 bills and handed it to me but instead of ones, she gave me a hundred in $20 bills. She counted it out again and put it in an envelope and handed it to me. I took it and just left. I justified it because at the time the government was bailing out banks with millions of dollars, so I figured that was my bailout money. The money really helped me out but I know I basically robbed the bank of $1900. Edit: I know I didn't rob the bank by doing a ""stick up"" with a gun but taking the money that didn't belong to me is still robbing them of it or stealing it. I did/do feel guilty. I used the money to buy groceries for me and my kid, gas for my car to get to work and the rest for bills. Edit 2: This was about 20 years ago. I was not a customer of that bank, so they didn't have any customer information on me. I had the cash on me about $130, my $25 in my checking account was with a different bank (it was only mentioned to say how broke I was).",Able_Future_3580,https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1jg58h1/i_walked_into_a_bank_and_just_robbed_it_years_ago/
confession,I sold sodas in high school after a ban of soft drinks was put into place to pay for senior fees. I ratted out my compettition.Light (self.confession),"Jr year a ban in CA prohibited sale of soda in public school (specifically LAUSD). I seeing a a need by many decided to spent my small savings from allowance (17.00) on 3 costco 24 packs. School was selling at the time for .75 cents prior to the ban. So I matched the price. Roughly making 18.00 every 24 pack which was about 13.00 in profit per 24 pack. After my first week and 3 trips to costco I made enough to buy more inventory per trip minimizing my trips to costco and cutting into profits. Added variety to what I had(started with Coke, then added Sprite, then dr pepper). At first I was holding in my locker but realize heat was an issue. Invested in an insulated bag and had 2-3 frozen waters inside to keep things cool, and added help was chilling the drinks the night before also, I was sold out on average before lunch or at the begining of lunch. 4 months I noticed sales drop and I was leaving school with inventory. Found out I had competition of others who not only picked up on what I was doing but started selling flavor variety like cherry coke, fanta, Shasta and what not. By this time I had already established myself with faculty and added diet cokes/diet dr peppers per request, yup, paid then off with free drinks which took a hit on profits weekly but secured me from getting in trouble with most security guards where I made transactions and classes I had and a few trusted teachers from previous semester. On average lost about a 6 pack to 9 sodas weekly, no big. Had the principal and a few vice principles buying as well. Needless to say competition wasnt something I needed. Had em get pinched by faculty once I found out who it was. Out of 6 (including myself) 4 got caught, the other gent I let him continue doing what he was doing because I knew his background and he and his fam needed the money. I did get pinched by a substitute in class, was sent to the same vice principle who was a buyer. All I was told was be careful and sat in his office till next class period started. My end goal was to pay for all senior fees which include cap, gown, diploma, senior night, prom and senior ring. By early senior yr I had made enough to cover all fees, including my tux rental and my portion of a limo for prom night. Also bought a PS2 and saved the rest as a base starting point for. Used car ( after starting a job and saving for an additional year it ended being a 97 honda accord, so nothin fancy) End of senior yr I helped 2 Jrs continue what I was doing and helped them figure it out and connected them to my faculty buyers. I have 0 regerts about it all. Update: Holy crap this blew up while I was in Class! What's gold?! What's silver?! Thank you to who ever gave them to me...can I buy soda with it!? I should also clarify this happened back late 02 to early 04. Just figured stature of limitations expired and figure some people would enjoy it. Appreciate the love Answering some questions: -Yes I'd do it all over again, roughly 1300 in student dues was a burden my parents didnt need on them, not including the 300.00 for tux and limo fees. I'm glad I didnt have to go sell candy to raise the money in a saturated market in which everyone was doing the same damn sales in the same district. -Yes, I was a snitch, but I felt I was in a position where I had 0 repercussions to face since I was well liked. It was a power move and it worked. The ones caught got a week detention and that was it.

confession,I won my sister her only hs scholarshipLight (self.confession),"This was three years ago when I was finishing grade 10 and my sister was finishing grade 12 about to graduate.

confession,I stole thousands from my employer and got away with it. (self.confession),"As you can probably guess from the title I found a gap in procedures and exploited the hell out of it. I wouldn't call it a loop hole, just a gap and the apathy of others. Circa 2005 I worked for a compay which sold bits and bobs of everything both in store and online. I did stints in the main distribution centre dealing with returns but mainly worked in store as a shift manager. Part of that role was dealing with returns which included things customers bought online. Big thing of the returns was that any item £10 or under which was opened was written off as waste and binned. If it was an online purchase it didn't require a physical receipt just confirmation from manager (me) that it was one of our products. This was also before refunds and returns could be done online. They could only be done in store. Bonus was that the refunds for online purchases could either be onto original payment card or in cash. Guess what i started doing. I started doing dodgy returns for non existent items. I also knew that the binned returns were sent to the distribution centre and binned from there and never truly counted (minimum wage, minimum effort) so stock counts were always off I only ever did small items and around £30 a day that i did it for. I did this successfully for 3 years and netted £17-18k ish cash and used it for my every day purchases and little bits went into saving account. Left after that and was able to put a deposit on a house and I wouldn't have been able to do that otherwise. Do i feel guilty? Nope. Would i do it again? No, but mainly because there wouldn't be anyway that I could get away with it. Do I feel sorry for companies which have a problem with theft by employees? No, mainly because they create the conditions which allow it to occur and thrive. In my experience employee theft happens because they hate the company or do not earn enough to live. The companies first reaction will always be to clamp down and tighten procedures to make it harder while ignoring the root cause. Why are your employees stealing? What can you do to make your employees not want to steal in the first place? Raise wages? Improve conditions? Improve mangers interpersonal skills? How about share incentives or profit sharing giving you employees some skin in the game. Whenever I hear of a company with a employee theft problem I automatically assume they must be terrible to work for and I have zero sympathy.",,https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1jy4w2c/i_stole_thousands_from_my_employer_and_got_away/

confession,"[No Regrets] After a briefly successful suicide attempt 8 months ago, I visited the bathroom I died in and words cannot express how grateful I am to be alive right now.No Regrets (self.confession)","On June 27th 2017 I intentionally overdosed on Heroin in the Handicap stall of the Ladies' room in Oglivie Transportation Center. And it worked. I was found with no pulse and not breathing. For MONTHS I resented the fact that I was brought back. I laid awake every night sobbing, abusing every drug I could get my hands on, and even attempted suicide two more times but to no avail. Since then I met the love of my life, and she makes me want to stay sober. I want to remember every moment I spend with her. She proposed to me a bit over a month ago and I want to live as long as possible so that I can grow old with her. On our first date we went to a protest, and got cold so entered the first building we saw. It was Ogilvie. We ate Panda Express and had our first kiss there. I didn't even realize it at the time but she gave me life in the building where I had almost successfully taken my life. Yesterday we went back there and I showed her exactly where I died. I am almost 5 months clean now and am so fucking happy that I was given another chance at life. The road leading here was rocky, but I'm grateful for every bump along the way because this was the road that lead me to her. That's not to say the road isn't still bumpy, but we have each other to ride it out with. We've had some devastating financial hardships recently and are homeless. But home is where the heart is. Home is holding hands and laughing at our situation from a bus stop bench. Home is cuddling up in an alley to stay warm in 0° weather. It's kind of funny that now I want to live, and I have to worry about surviving. This is a new feeling. It's stressful, but I'm happy. The only tears I've been crying lately are happy ones. Edit: I'm not depending my life and sobriety on one other person, I was already on medication, sober, in therapy and on the right track when I met her. She just makes me extra grateful for life because I didn't think love would ever be an option for me and she supports me and my healthy goals.",nihilist_ic,https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/85ruqu/no_regrets_after_a_briefly_successful_suicide/
confession,I kicked a kid in his balls and he had to have one removed. (self.confession),"This happened when I was around 7 or 8 years old. It was my first year in Primary school and I had joined the school with some of my friends from the local feeder school in the area. One particular boy was a year older than us and was repeating the first year for some reason. He was of German descent, from a very well to do family and a lot bigger than the rest of us. Possibly because he was embarrassed at repeating the year he was a bit of a bully. He often picked on me and some of my friends. I’m sure we probably escalated things at times too because I know he was teased for being German. So one day, standing outside class I kicked him full whack in the balls. He buckled over but I can’t really remember much of what happened afterwards, we probably tucked tail and ran. I can’t even say for sure whether he deserved to be kicked at the time or if I just thought I was getting him back for previous behaviour. Anyway, he missed school for a few days after and I heard some kids saying he was in hospital. Soon after that I was called in to speak to a teacher who as far as I remember dressed me down and explained he had gone home and his testicle has swollen up to the size of a tennis ball and it had to be removed. I don’t really remember getting into much trouble about it but I do remember some of the other kids going on about it in banter. The details are hazy but I felt so bad and I felt I was in so much trouble that I never ever told my parents about it. This was made worse as my dad and his dad had gone to school together, only found this out after seeing my dad chatting to his dad at a rugby match that me and the kid were playing one Saturday about a year after. I was freaking out the whole time they were speaking and then started feeling guilty that my Dad might have been seen as rude by his Dad for not apologising for my action. It didn’t come across that way, as they seemed like old friends catching up but I felt so guilty. I felt so awful about it, I mean at the time I didn’t realise that it may have an affect on him being able to have children but I felt like I’d done something so horrible and always expected my family to confront me about it. When I learnt of the reproductive challenge this might cause the guilt was just amplified. The years that followed in primary school were mostly fine, on the odd occasion he would have a go at me, I remember him having a slightly shorter fuse with me than others but I think he ended up being ok and less of a bully. Saying that, he did try drown me in a river at our primary school leavers camp as I’d pissed him off for some reason but mostly the in-between years went by without incident. I left that school to go to a different high school so I never maintained contact with him. I saw him once during my teenage years and we chatted for about 5 minutes. I remember it being friendly. I never, ever mentioned it. I hope he was able to have children. I’m sorry bro.

confession,I met my current boyfriend by slipping him my number while he was on a date with someone else and I was their server.No Regrets (self.confession),"I used to work at a Cheesecake Factory as a server. About 1.5 years ago my current boyfriend came in with some other girl for a date. I’m not sure what it is about my boyfriend but he just does it for me. He’s not at all my normal type of guy I’m attracted to but for some reason he just makes me melt every time I look at him. He’s got this super self assured smile and something about the way he talks gets me. He’s got this little chuckle he does and he always looks down and bites his lip after...he’s just like it for me. So I immediately rushed over to their table. Typically, if I saw a guy I was attracted to I could give better service because I genuinely wanted to interact with him and everyone at the table and that usually lead to nicer tips. When I started serving them, I couldn’t help myself and I was flirting super obviously. So much so my coworkers were telling me to be careful I didn’t get complained on. But he flirted back so I was like a shark who smelled blood in the water. I spent so much time talking to him at their table other tables I was serving had to call out to me because I’d forget about them. Honestly, looking back that was more of a date for me and him than her and him because we talked about what he did for work, what I studied, what my favorite foods are, what he likes, music. I must have been at that table, accumulatively, for around 40 minutes. At the end of it she was being very short with me and him and I kind of figured she’d complain. So I said screw it, scribbled my number down and put it under his card when I gave it back to him. He texted me that night and we’ve basically been dating since. I’m moving in with him on Friday. It was honestly a very rude and shitty thing to do, but I’d do it over again in a second.",imabadpersonsometime,https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/8lmu1o/i_met_my_current_boyfriend_by_slipping_him_my/
confession,I trash my coworkers mugs and dishes when they leave it soaking in the community sink.Light (self.confession),"At work we have a kitchenette and at the end of the day, my coworkers leave their dishes/mugs filled with oatmeal and other things left to soak. We even have a sign that states “Do not leave personal belongings in the kitchenette. We are not responsible for lost items”. I stay at work pretty late so I see the night janitor come in and clean. I noticed that he goes out of his way to wash the dishes and mugs, which isn’t a part of his job (our company only contracts them to do floors and trash so it’s our responsibility to clean up after ourselves). My coworkers must have noticed too because they have since stopped doing their own dishes and has been leaving piles in the sink knowing that they will be magically washed and dried in the morning. They even make comments about the “Mexican sucker” that’s cleaning for them. This has been on going for a few weeks now and my coworkers even have the audacity to complain about water spots on their mugs. So throughout the day when I find myself alone in the kitchenette, I take an item or two and toss them out in the building hallway trash so it can’t be found. We work in a building where we share office space with other businesses and there’s no cameras so I haven’t been caught yet. A coworker asked our manager about their items being taken, but my manager just reiterated the policy. I guess I am being petty, but my coworkers are trash and I don’t feel bad. Edit: I should have clarified that I don’t do this everyday (the janitors days off) and I when I do, it’s throughout the day time so no one can place blame on the night janitor. I know some people are considerate and wash their dishes and mugs so by the time I’m throwing stuff out, it’s been at least a day or two of sitting there. I’m keeping tabs. My manger is cool and doesn’t care when people complain and refers them to the policy and shrugs it off basically saying “tough shit”.",NonphotosyntheticCat,https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/avj3ko/i_trash_my_coworkers_mugs_and_dishes_when_they/

confession,I lie to my parents about money so I can have a better life (self.confession),"I’ve never admitted this to anyone except my husband but I come from a family where everyone borrows money from everyone. My dad guilt tripped me into taking out close to $30000 in loans (which is crap ton of debt in the country I’m in) to help him get his business off the ground. My aunts and uncles are always borrowing money to each other. Although I’ve managed to bring our debt down considerably, he doesn’t understand the impact it’s had on me. My parents even had the audacity to ask my husband for his inheritance to help the business out. All because we’re family. But I lied to them about how much he actually got because its my husbands money. I hate it so much. I think this mentality of borrowing money is a poverty mindset. And so now I just lie to them and tell them we never have any money. That we’re living cheque to cheque even though we’re financially stable and doing well for ourselves. We live on little so my family doesn’t know we have money. I sometimes feel guilty but then I get over that very quickly when I see them by buying motorbikes and new cars and spending $400 each on leather jackets. I will continue lying to them even if they’re struggling financially because they don’t make smart financial decisions and I don’t want that for myself.

The only thing stopping me was that I was afraid there was going to be someone on the other side and I didn’t want to hurt anyone. Well the last day comes around and I said fuck it, and kicked that door as hard as I could. My friend and teammate was on the other side and the door caught on her big toe, pulling it back and breaking it so badly she couldn’t compete for almost a year, missed regionals, and ended up quitting. She just assumed I had pushed the door open like a normal person but nope. I karate kicked that bitch. I still feel bad about it and it was about 15 years ago.

confession,I conspired with our local brewpub to stop selling my husband growlers of IPA because the beer made him smell so bad.Light (self.confession),"I may get downvoted for this but here goes. My husband loves IPA beer but it makes him smell so bad it's not even funny. It just reeks out his pores and will actually make our sheets and his pillow case smell bad. It also really doesn't matter what brand or how high quality it is, whatever is in IPA doesn't mix with his body chemistry. His favorite beer by far is from a local brewpub. I'd say he was drinking about 2/3 growlers of their IPA a week. I finally couldn't take it anymore so one day at lunch I went in and asked to speak with the owner. He is a very super cool guy and he said that he also can't stand IPAs because it's the reason so many bad breweries have been able to open because IPAs take very little skill to make and people often cover up mistakes with the intense flavors. So he and I worked out a deal that any time my husband came in, he and is workers would tell him they were out of IPA but they would offer him a more traditional lager at a discount. Our hope was that eventually he'd lose the taste for IPA and stop stinking up our house. I even offered to work out a deal with the owner that I pay him whatever he was losing in the discount and he told me not to worry about it. So it's actually worked. I've tricked my husband's taste buds into liking lighter beer and he seems to be past the disgusting IPA stage and he smells way better.

confession,I faked liking Hiking and now i’m deep in the woods… literally and emotionally (self.confession),"I’ve been pretending to love hiking for YEARS, and now I’m in way too deep. It started as a lie to impress a guy, and now I’m halfway to becoming Bear Grylls against my will. So, a few years ago I started dating this guy who was all about “adventure” and “living life to the fullest” (read: he owned a Patagonia jacket and had a carabiner for some reason). On our third date he asked if I liked hiking. I wanted him to like me, so I said, “Oh my god, I love hiking. Nature is my therapy.” Huge mistake. We went on a hike that weekend. It was six hours long. My legs almost gave out halfway up the trail and I got bitten by a spider that may or may not have been poisonous. But I smiled through the pain and said things like, “Wow, look at that view,” while secretly trying not to cry. Now it’s three years later. We’re still dating. I’ve become “the hiking girl” to all his friends. People message me for trail recommendations. I’ve received gifts of hiking socks. I own a water bottle that says “Take a hike” unironically. The worst part🙂‍↕️I hate hiking. I hate bugs. I hate sweating. I hate being more than ten minutes away from a bathroom. But I’ve committed so hard that I now lead monthly group hikes for his coworkers. I have a Google spreadsheet for “upcoming summits.” I once pretended to love a view so much I cried (it was just the altitude and dehydration).

confession,"I stole and used my college roommate’s fleshlight, then threw it out (self.confession)","It wasn’t a real fleshlight, just a knockoff that looked like a mouth wearing bright red lipstick. He said he bought it as a joke and wasn’t actually going to use it. One night we went out to a party - At the end of the night my roommate left with a girl and I went home alone. I was pretty drunk and horny, remembered his knockoff fleshlight, and thought borrowing it would be a great idea. I could use it then clean and return it and he’d have no idea. I grabbed it, lubed it up and went to town. It actually felt quite nice. Shortly after finishing, but before I had a chance to clean things up, I hear the front door opening... Roommate had come home early. I panicked and needed to get rid of the evidence as soon as possible, so I opened the window and threw the sex toy out. It landed in the center of our dorm’s quad (grassy area where students sit, play frisbee, etc), and that was that. The next day I went outside to look for it, but it was already gone.

confession,I (34m) house sit for other people with the specific goal of going through their things. (self.confession),"So I’ve been a house sitter/dog watcher for a number of years. It’s truly easy money. I’m excellent at what I do. Odds are your place will be cleaner than when you left for your vacation or work trip. I’ll collect your mail and organize it by the date it was delivered, wash all my towels and bed sheets, never have guest over, etc, etc. However unknown to you and every person who has let me house sit. I’m going to go through your things. Specifically your clothes. Mainly just your clothes. I’ll open and go through every closet, and open and go through all your drawers. Dresses, suits, bathing suits, sweaters, pants, skirts, underwear, scarves, jackets, hosiery, hats, you own it, I’m going to take a look. If I really like something, if it really catches my eye or gets my heart going, I’ll try it on. I’ll stand in front of your mirror and see how it fits me. I’ll wear it around the house and see how it feels. Especially if you’re married woman, for some reason your things in particular I love to look through and wear. Yes the thrill is doing something I’m not supposed to be doing and the thrill of possibly getting caught in your sexiest outfit. But mainly, if you thought it was nice enough to buy and wear, I want to see why. When I’m done, I’ll fold it back up, or hang it exactly how I found it. You never know. How do I know, because you’ve asked me to house sit again and again and again. It started when I was back in high school. My friends would have a party, and when everyone was outside, I’d go upstairs and see what their mom had tucked away, then I’d try it on see how I looked, the fold it back and put it away like nothing ever happened. Then I started house sitting, and found out I could have free reign and not have to sneak around. I’m sure this all sounds incredibly creepy, and like a breach of trust, I’m not looking for advice, just wanted to get it off my chest. Looking back it does feel wrong, so I regret it, now.",,https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1kck8n3/i_34m_house_sit_for_other_people_with_the/
confession,I sent a prostitute to my boss' hotel roomLight (self.confession),"This was an accident and happened about 10 years ago. I had recently joined a Chinese owned company in a fairly prominent position and being the only white guy in the company, they liked to send me to trade shows in China to indicate that the company was definitely NOT Chinese. I was sent to Guangzhou to the Hotel Dong Fang just around the corner from the convention centre (extraneous detail not really needed but here to show this is genuine). Of course with a convention centre in town with many visitors, the prostitute madams/agents were out in force. Most of the people handing out cards for whores where very young kids (seriously young. They looked about 10 years old or younger), often the only English they spoke was, ""You buy, so cheap"". Every time I went out, I had kids pushing cards into my hands, into my pockets or dropped into any boxes I was carrying. Most of the time that was that. End of story. On my my second to last day, I went out with the sole intention of buying presents for my wife and daughter, when after the first shop I was approached by an older madam who would not leave me alone. Every step of the way she kept with me encouraging me to ""buy, so cheap"". Even my protestations that I was married and not interested was met with, ""your wife not here, you buy. So cheap"". Eventually, she said, ""Tell me your room number. I send girl to your room. Just $200"". Thinking this was the best way to get rid of her I said, ""$200? OK, I'm in room 1024"" and then carried on shopping. Since this was a fake room number and I had no intention of carrying out the transaction, I promptly forgot about it. Next day, last day of the show, I was told the boss had flown to Beijing and I was needed to help a colleague collect some stuff from his hotel room. I walked with my colleague, dodging the kids with prostitute cards, back to the hotel until I was standing outside my boss's room. Room 1024. I have never, ever dared ask or say anything to my boss about this. Only my wife knows this story. And so, too, do you. TL/DR: I accidentally sent a hooker to my boss's hotel room - pretty much what it says in the title.",Soixante-neuf-Dec,https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/8xsmd7/i_sent_a_prostitute_to_my_boss_hotel_room/
confession,I stole a microwave from Walmart out of desperation (self.confession),"I while back while I was still in college I lived with my then fiancée in a very over-priced apartment in a relatively big city. At the time, my job was only paying about $7.50/hr and I was studying and working full-time just to pay the bills. Basically a decent yet expensive apartment, and just enough money to pay the bills.. not much wiggle room. Well one night my S/O was at work and I was at home, heating up some leftovers for dinner in our microwave and as I go to take the plate out, it slips and hits the door of the microwave on the inner edge and completely shatters the front of the microwave. So I'm freaking, expecting my S/O to come home mad at me and/or just stressing about having to buy another one. And then I saw a walmart receipt on the counter and I went to walmart. It was probably around 9pm, my S/O was going to be getting off soon, so I'm rushing. I walk in, find the exact same model of microwave that we have, and grab it off the shelf. I took the receipt out of my pocket and held it with the microwave, and just walked out the door. After getting it out and setting it up I told my S/O I cleaned the microwave. Never told a soul about it. That was probably about 6 years ago... still using the microwave :/ EDIT: Holy shit I didn't think this would get so much attention. I'm going to reply to some comments later today but I'm about to work a 10 hour shift so it'll be a while. Also yes my relationship dynamic at the time was toxic.

confession,I secretly changed our bedLight (self.confession),"Me and my wife bought a new bed. A really expensive one, the kind that has separate firmness on each side. We spent hours and hours in the store, where my wife took her time testing and deciding what kind of lower mattress she wanted on her side. Beforehand, she had done extensive web research on what kind of bed would give her most happiness in life, and so on. Eventually she settled for one with firmness between soft and medium. Me, I couldn’t be bothered with that. I’ve always liked my beds soft, but the store lady said that with my body composition, I should have a hard mattress. So during a brief brain fart, I chose that. Next morning, I knew I had f*ed up. The $2000 bed I’d just bought felt awful. Even worse, when installing it I’d taken the plastic wrapping off the lower mattresses so I couldn’t return them. The solution - while my wife was at work I flipped the bed 180 degrees, so that now I have the soft mattress, and she has the concrete slab. There are two additional full width, thick mattresses on top of those, so it’s not immediately noticeable. This was five years ago. I’ve slept like a baby ever since. My wife apparently still hasn’t noticed, at least she hasn’t said anything, and she seems to sleep well.

confession,I lied about completing a project in the 8th grade and passed anyway.Light (self.confession),"I completely and 100% DESPISED homework as a kid (and about half of my teenage years). When I was in the 8th grade, we were assigned a project towards the end of the year that counted for a pretty big percentage of our overall grade. From what I can remember, it had something to do with shapes and equations - it was basically like a large project of everything we learned the whole year. I didn’t wanna do it. I worked on it a very small amount here and there, but never completed it. The math teacher collected them over a period of a few days, and then was going to spend a few more days grading them all. I played along to all of my other classmates that I turned mine in and even explained what it (maybe) looked like. The day came and she was finishing up grading all of them, and as she finished each one she gave them back, so some students had already taken theirs home. So she’s sitting at her desk and asks, “spoopypuppy, have I graded yours yet?” And I quickly replied, “Yes ma’am, you gave it back to me a couple days ago.” Some wonderful, powerful magic force was working hard that day, because all she said was, “Oh, I forgot to write your grade down. Do you remember what it was?” I didn’t want to aim too high because I knew what work I was capable of, so I simply said, “You wrote 89.” And she just wrote it down in her grade book!!!!! She didn’t question to see it again or anything!!! I couldn’t believe it worked. That was the only time that ever worked, but it worked nonetheless. I passed math because of that lie.

The commute to my job was very long and she lived much closer. It sounds weird to work so young and also to travel for work but it was a family business.

I dig through her entertainment center looking for a blank tape, find one, and slip it into the VCR. I set it to record and then go to bed. I lay awake in bed terrified because if I fall asleep and someone turns on the tv before I get up, they’re going to know it was tuned to a dirty channel. When the first pinky streaks of morning show in the sky I’m up and in damage control mode. I snatch the tape, change the channel, make sure everything is neat and tidy with the tapes underneath the tv. That’s when I find a yellowed label that has fallen off a tape. It says “Cindy and Darrel Wedding 1985” no no no no no. Look at the “blank” tape in my hand, see the faint outline of where a label used to be. They line up perfectly. Noooooooooo. Suddenly I have this smoking gun of a horrible thing I did in my possession. Anybody who watched the tape would see 30 seconds of her getting ready with her bridesmaids, cut to half of a porno set in the workplace, then it cuts out later to reveal mid wedding ceremony.

confession,"I got chemically attacked last night, and while panicking, I did something horrible (self.confession)","My family went on a trip yesterday, and I have 5 younger siblings, so we needed 2 hotel rooms. I was bunked with 2 younger siblings, while my parents and the others slept in room #2 I was still on my phone around 3 AM, when I heard some commotion in the hallway directly outside our room. A few people were arguing, but it was muffled, I couldn't gague anything. Eventually I got up so I could call the front desk about it, but then I felt it My eyes and nose were suddenly under attack. There was no scent, just pain. I woke up my siblings and told them we needed to run, to the emergency exit for safe air. Halfway there though, I had a scary thought, what if the rest of my family is asleep in room #2? I don't know what this chemical is, what if its capable of killing somebody without waking them up? So I ran back, pounded on their door, and took off for the emergency exit. I waited outside with my younger siblings, trying to breathe it out, but I got scared, cause the rest of my family took a long time to escape. It turns out they were awake and heard the commition in the hall. Then when they heard me pound on their door, they thought I was the attackers. They shouted whos there, but I didn't hear it, because I ran away to try and escape the chemical Because of me, my family was trapped in there for nearly a minute, including my 3 year old sister, whos probably traumatized. We think that it was bear spray (basically a pepper spray grenade), meaning there won't be any permanent damage to us, but it was still agony at the time Why did I have to pound on that door, my panicking caused so much more pain than necessary, and probably traumatized my sister. Evacutating my little siblings was so scary, I wish I knew the chemical wasn't lethal. Trying to comfort my baby sister was so hard, she was shaking so much she thought she was cold. But she was warm to the touch, she just didn't know how to process how scared she was EDIT: thank you everyone. i was expecting some poeple to tell me i did my best, and other people to be mad at me for putting my family in so much danger. the nice things you've said, and the fact that every single person seems to agree i did okay, is giving me a lot of comfort. im still not doing great, but you are making this guilt a lot more bareable EDIT 2: i love puyo puyo tetris",Candid-Extension6599,https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1ifhrst/i_got_chemically_attacked_last_night_and_while/
confession,My favourite thing working as a window washer was going through peoples private possessions. (self.confession),"So I worked as a window washer in my small town in Sweden for about 5 years. Every morning you went to the warehouse were we had all of our stuff, drank a cup of coffee with your co-workers and talked for a bit before getting to know the places you had to go to that day, and who you had to do them with. Our bosses were very keen on everyone getting to know everyone so they changed up the ""teams"" every day. This meant sometimes you got to go out by yourself. A typical workday is going to 4-5 houses and/or apartments, sometimes old people (they were always home), sometimes familys who were home because they knew we were coming. Not very often, you got people who left their key under the mat and let us go inside without them being home. I likes this the most, since you didn´t have anyone breathing down your neck while you worked. And sometimes, once in a blue moon, you got a house, with nobody home, by yourself. I don't know if there´s something wrong with me (maybe). But to me it felt like I had struck gold, because I knew, I would be able to walk around that house, by myself, checking out every inch of it. I usally started by doing my job super fast! Make sure I had some way of knowing if they got home. Usally I placed a ladder somewhere close to the door so if someone came home they had to move it. Then I got to work. I NEVER looked to steal anything, it was pure curiosity. I looked through bathroom cabinets, nightstands, desk drawers and basically anything that you could open, while making sure everything I touched was placed back exactly where it was before. During my years I´ve found diaries with dark secrets, cute secrets and just downright wierd secrets. I´ve found used condoms in the teenage boys room, dildos and vibrators in the daughters/mothers nightstands.I found a gun under a matress (which in Sweden is not something you see everyday) One couple had a sex-swing hanging in the bedroom, so it´s not really something I needed to look for but I thought it was strange that they didn't take it down when they knew people were going to be in the house. I once opened a teenagers Macbook, and BOOM, Pornhub, paused mid-video. No password. No incognito window, nothing. Jewelry, expensive watches and knifes. One kid had a 3 knifes welded toghether like a ninjastar but with a handle. Like I said. Never stole anything. That wasn't my goal. I just loved going though other peoples shit. It´s wrong. I know that. But I couldn´t help myself.",,https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/bls8vr/my_favourite_thing_working_as_a_window_washer_was/

confession,I used to go into random homes in my neighborhood when the occupants weren't home. (self.confession),"This was in the mid 80's when security wasn't like it is now and also, lot's of families didn't even lock their doors. The first time I ever did this was when I was riding my bike in the neighborhood and saw a front door of a home wide open. I peeked in and said ""hello"" just to see if someone was home. No one answered. I stood in the living room just scanning the area and got spooked and left. After that day, I was hooked on it. I would wait for people to leave and enter through which ever door/window was open and would walk around. I never stole anything but I did open drawers, closets and went through personal belongings. I once found a wad of money rolled in up a sock. I took the money and sock and put it in the next drawer over. I felt like I needed to leave a mark so I ended up moving dishes in cabinets. Like, I switched the cups with plates and moved utensil drawers to another spot in the kitchen. I did this in about 8 or 9 homes until people started talking and getting suspicious and of course, people started locking their doors, including our family. I stopped after that. Someone did call the police but nothing ever came of it since nothing was stolen. I haven't trespassed in anyone's home but I do switch things around in other homes when I'm invited over.",crentastic,https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/cktj9a/i_used_to_go_into_random_homes_in_my_neighborhood/
confession,I entered a strangers house to avoid a DUI (self.confession),"I live in australia. Not sure how it works in the rest of the world but i was on my provisional drivers license as a teenager (we call them P-plates) and when you are on that you cannot have ANY alcohol in your blood whatsoever. I stayed at my mates place one night and he had some beers to drink. I had two knowing i had to drive the next day and was gonna stop but he convinced me to have another so i did. The next day i got in my car to drive home and as I was turning a corner there were a couple police doing an RBT (random breath test) and i panicked. I knew full well id have a little bit of alcohol in me and thats enough to lose my license for a couple months. I had just left school and gotten a really good job and if i got a drink driving charge i would have to rely on my parents to drive me there which wouldn’t work out as they both have jobs. I panicked and turned right onto another street. I drove halfway down the road thinking i had gotten away with it but one of the cars suddenly turned round the corner and blasted the sirens. I pulled over and the cop came to my window. Cop: can you explain to me why you just avoided an RBT? Instead of explaining to the cop why and just taking my punishment I decided to lie. Me: I wasn’t trying to avoid it, i live down here Cop: where abouts do you live? Me: just over there Cop: well you don’t mind if i follow you and watch you enter your house for proof do you? Kinda shit myself but agreed. He got in his car and i drove into a driveway halfway down the street and walked up to the door. My current plan was to just explain to whoever is at the door whats going on and hope he lets me inside. I walked up and knocked but no one answered. Then i looked over my shoulder at the cop and turned to just open the door and it was unlocked. I walked inside and shut the door. I was really scared for if whoever lived there was gonna walk out and see me and scream but no one did. I stayed at the door peeking out the window at the cop and he left after about 10 minutes. I waited another 10 minutes before walking down and driving off again with a big sigh of relief. Not here to condone drink driving or anything. I made a mistake and it was wrong. Just sharing this story EDIT: PLEASE READ BEFORE COMMENTING just to answer some questions that are being asked frequently; Why didn’t the cop check my License? I don’t know he just didn’t. He asked why i was avoiding him and then followed me to make sure i was telling the truth. Same answer for why he didn’t scan my plates Why did you knock on the door? Again I don’t know. I didn’t want to just enter a strangers house. Three beers would have been out of my system? Maybe. Depends on the percentage of the beer itself and what time i had my last one. I didn’t specify either and it was 6 or 7 years ago so i cant really tell you. I know that i could still taste it on my breath when i left that morning",,https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/en31v9/i_entered_a_strangers_house_to_avoid_a_dui/

confession,Indirectly Broke a dryer at a laundromat then gave a fake name and number to the ownerLight (self.confession),"Update- I honestly went back to the same laundromat this past Sunday. Did my laundry, didn't break anything went about my day lol. Thank you everyone for the karma and upvotes Last night was doing laundry at the local laundromat. I had 3 washers going at once. Now normally, you fill the wash, add detergent, add quarters and select the cycle. When I pressed the cycle button normally the previously selected cycle button pops out kinda like a switch. I didn't notice it but it happened with this washer. So the washer had 2 cycle buttons pressed. About half hour goes by and washer 1&2 are done but washer 3 is still on the first part of the cycle. Now it being 9pm and with the placing closing at 10 I decide to take the unfinished soaking wet clothes and put them in the dryer. About 2 minutes into the dryer the laundry attendant said I broke the dryer bc of the wet clothes. She took my wet clothes and put it in machine that just spins the clothes dry and then put them back in the dryer. She asked for my name and phone number so I wrote down ""Trevor Lahey"" and some random collection of 10 digits. Those of you who watch Trailer Park Boys will understand. So as the the last dryer is finishing the owner comes in ask me what happened. He couldn't believe that washer 3 didn't spin dry my clothes and was stuck in the same cycle for 1.5 hours until I had to physically show him how all the other washers work the same except for washer 3. He still even tried to spin it on me for breaking the dryer bc I didn't tell the attendant about the washer. So anyway he grabbed the piece of paper with my fake name and number and said that he'll give me a call tomorrow (today) to see how much the dryer is gonna cost to be fixed or replaced. Lol fuck off",,https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/asctjj/indirectly_broke_a_dryer_at_a_laundromat_then/
confession,I Almost strangled my mother to death when I was 15Remorse (self.confession),"Reposting this here instead of in r/offmychest, cause this sub seems more fitting. I have been browsing offmychest and this subreddit for a few hours now, since I couldn't sleep. Figured I might aswell chip in my story, since I don't often talk about this irl for obvious reasons. Please mind that English is not my native language. As you can guess from the title, it's not a very happy story. Buckle up, this'll be a long ride. tldr at the bottom. My parents broke up very early, I grew up with my mom. My dad wasn't really present throughout my childhood. My mother has had a drinking problem for as long as I can remember. She had a rough upbringing and could only vent her frustration when she was drunk. The way things went down was always the same. Around once a month she comes home late, waking me in the middle of the night. From then on it's a shitshow. She starts yelling, spitting at me, beating me. Smears her snot in my face or on my bedsheets and makes me sleep in there. One second she yells in my face that she hates me, that my father and grandma hate me, that it's all my fault and in the next second she starts crying and says that she loves me, emotional rollercoaster. This always goes on for the whole night. I don't remember too much but ironically the most prominent memories are the ones from when I was very young, maybe around 5 or something. One night I had to stand facing the wall the whole night while she screamed at me. I was so tired since I was just a little kid but everytime I tried to sit down she would hit me. Sometimes I had to do squats while pulling at my ears, making me look really stupid. Apart from the fact that it was humiliating, she made me do them until I collapsed from the pain, then she shouted at me to continue. A weird thing she did was she frequently pretended to choke to death in the middle of a rant. She then lay there motionless for 10 minutes straight. As a 5 year old, I was completely in panic and had no idea what to do. I tried to wake her up but she didn't respond at all until she suddenly jerked up and resumed shouting at and hitting me for ""not helping her"". Luckily she stopped pulling that one once she saw that I got too used to it. As I got older she got more and more violent, but the only times I was really scared for my life was when she got the kitchen knife while fighting with her (now ex) fiancée. Luckily no one was ever stabbed. I could go on and on but you get the idea. I never got any help because I was so used to all this stuff. And ofc my mother told me to never tell anyone. Whenever I brought her bahaviour up in the next morning she claimed that she couldn't remember, said that I'm overexaggerating things, or outright claimed I was making stuff up. Sometimes she apologized ""I will never do it again, honey"". I stopped listening after a while. School was pretty shit aswell. I had no social skills because I preferred to play video games all day. I was a weird and misbehaving kid, so I was bullied a lot. Also I was too afraid to stand up for myself, because I only knew punishment. The fact that we often moved didn't help much. All in all I went to 10 different elementary schools across 4 different countries. Poland was especially shit. Not the country, you Polish folk are nice people :) but living with this rich alcoholic dude whom my mother constantly fought with was. Thank god that episode only lasted a few months. Anyway, I digress. Unsurprisingly I became depressed at some point and have been ever since. don't know when exactly, I think it was somewhere around 10 years old. This torture went on for many years. Then it happened. She came home drunk one morning morning while I was getting ready for school. She didn't get much of a reaction out of me these days and didn't seem to like it. As mentioned in the title I was 15 years old at that time and getting physically stronger than her and I was used to the shouting. Also I was basically dead inside. I was completely nonchalant when she started her rant. Then she said something about my ex gf. It wasn't really all that bad but it was a weak spot for me since she recently broke up with me, it was my first relationship and I was the one who fucked it up. It was the last straw. All these fucking years of constant abuse and neglect unloaded themselves in one moment. Humans can be animals. It was like watching a movie from a 3rd person perspective. I had no control whatsoever. I screamed while grabbing her throat and squeezing with all I had. I somehow strangled her across my whole room onto the bed. My big and scary mother whom I was always afraid of wasn't able to fight back against my rage. Not one bit. Now thinking back she even looked kinda scared. So she was on her back on my bed and I was standing above her, squeezing her throat. I have no idea how long that went on, maybe a few seconds, maybe half a minute. Everything felt so surreal. At some point my brain kicks in: ""do you really want to do that?"" I get ahold of myself and I let go of her. fucking mistake. She instantly grabs a chair and starts swinging at me full force. I mean yeah, I technically tried to kill her but now I just want to get out of this alive. I block it and it fucks up my arm. Then she fucking bites me in the very same arm jesus fucking christ that hurt. The bite later swole to the size of a ping pong ball. Anyway I manage to get the hell out of that appartement but now I run the risk of freezing to death since we had winter and I'm wounded with nothing on me but my pyjamas. I encounter a neighbour and ask him to call the cops. I tell them what happened (leaving out the strangling part) and after they see my wounds they inform my mother that I'm being taken into care. My mom makes a pathetic attempt of trying to put on an act but snaps halfway through and bites an officer, gets wrestled down and arrested on the spot (It was honestly hilarious in hindsight, she played the victim and called me a traitor for calling the cops on her) but got out later on. She had to pay a huge fine though for attacking an officer. I moved out into government care. It was honestly cool. By the end of age 15, I had my own appartement for free rent, 400€ per month to do with whatever the hell I want and social workers that were pretty decent people (Kudos to German CPS). However shit caught up with me, my depression worsened badly, I started to drink a lot and later that year I tried to drown myself. That was rock bottom for me. I've had bad phases since then, there were nights where I wanted to die, nights where I wanted to pay my mother a visit and get my revenge and nights where I didn't want anything at all. However all in all life's been gradually improving for me. Slowly but steadily. The older I got, the more self-aware I became about my behaviour so I stopped getting bullied. Also I learned to stand up for myself, that was helpful. However I still ended up quitting school at some point. I realized I can't force myself to do something I despise for even a second. I just stood up in the middle of class and went ""fuck it"". After that I tried a bunch of different jobs but none of them worked for me. However I found my true passion. I love making music, and I'm currently putting all my energy into becoming a successful musician. I no longer care if I might fail, it's really liberating! My relationship with my mother has been improving steadily aswell. Boy it was hard at first, and I made sure to let her know how much I hated her for what she did, but she finally, truly admitted her mistakes and quit drinking. It was easier after that. I could start expressing and letting go of my hatred in a healthy way. She really made an effort to better herself. I also apologised for what I did that day and she forgave me. I wish I could tell you a happy ending to that part of the story but sadly my mom was diagnosed with schizophrenia two years ago. The stress of coming to terms with what she did and the loneliness probably broke her. Sometimes I think about what I could have done differently. She knows that i still haven't forgiven her and am still suffering every day because of what happened. But I can't change that. I told her it needs time. It's been only six years since the day police took me. She's back in her home country now with her family, they're taking care of her. Thank god for that. The last two years were a huge burden. At one point she was so thin that you could see the shape of her skull, all while having that giddy delusional smile on her face. Horrifying. Well, there it is. The story of how I tried to kill my mother. I apologise for the swearing, I got a bit emotional while writing this. Granted, a lot of bad stuff happened in the past but it made me the way I am today, and I'm glad for that. I learned many things and I wouldn't trade that for the world. People become who they are based on circumstances, but it is always in our power to change our fate. Don't hate them, no matter what they do to you. Cruel people are often hurting inside. Instead encourage them to be the best they can be! Life's too short to be unhappy. Strive towards your goals and never settle for less! It could always be your last day on earth, you literally have nothing to lose! Life's definitely not fair. Cherish what you've been given and make the best of it. Suicide will prevent you from ever becoming happy. However I realize I'm still only 21 years old and have a lot to learn. I plan on doing so. I don't want to live a life full of hatred and regret, I want to be able to love and trust somebody again. I want to get married, have at least 3 children, become a successful musician, travel the world, stuff like that. Just be happy. I know I'll get there, one day at a time. Tl;dr - I was constantly abused by my mother and bullied in school since my early childhood and snapped one day, almost strangling my mother to death. Police took me in and after a while things got gradually better between us. I've pretty much made up with her. Now I try to live my life as best as I can. Phew, I did it! It feels like I wrote up an entire novel. Contrary to my expectations, I actually feel better now! If anyone made it 'til here, thank you for reading! :) EDIT: I'm waking up this morning and Jesus Christ this blew up... I've read some comments and want to thank you guys so much for your kind words!! They mean a lot to me! I'll try to answer some comments later if there are any quesions. Also people have been asking me about my music. I prefer not to disclose anything here, I don't want to turn this into an advertisement for my songs. :) EDITEDIT: I'm at a loss for words, man. Just thank you all so much for your kind words, even those of you who had critical things to say! It's just surreal. These comments are coming in faster than I can reply but there is something I wanted to adress, since it popped up a few times. I understand that a lot of emotions can be stirred up by such a delicate topic, especially if you experienced abuse yourselves. Maybe it's partly my fault, because I focused too much on the negative aspects of our relationship. If so, then I apologize. But please, if you can, don't write hateful comments about my mother. Some things did go very wrong, yes. But she also did the best she could in raising me. There was always food on the table, she tried showing affection in her own way, she cared for my interests and education etc. and I firmly believe that she has always loved me. She just couldn't always express it, as she's as much a victim of abuse as I am. That's why it hurts me seeing comments like ""you should have killed her"" We have to be better than that! I know we can! So I just want to make it clear that even after what happened I love her. After all, she is my mom. 07/2022 update: after a few very hard and painful years of dealing with (of course she came back from her home country after a month. fuck me lol) and trying to convince her, my mom finally agreed to medication treatment last year. She has made an incredible recovery. All symptoms have been completely gone since she started.

confession,I used to steal coffee from Starbucks. (self.confession),"A couple years ago I downloaded the Starbucks app and signed up for the membership to save my card and orders and such. After signing up, you get a coupon in your email for a free coffee of any make/size. At first, I didn’t know you had to load it to the app after ordering, so when I went up to the counter and ordered my usual venti caramel Frappuccino with an extra pump caramel and extra caramel drizzle. I proceeded to show the barista the code I had in the email, and he said, “it has to be loaded onto the app.” I honestly had no clue how to use the code, but instead of going through the whole process on the app, he just let me have the free drink. I took this knowledge and used it on other Starbucks throughout my town for almost a year.

confession,"I shoplifted over $6,000 worth of clothing in one stint. (self.confession)","This was almost ten years ago. I was a sales associate as a teen at a well known chain retail skate store. It was a cool job but my store manager sucked. Just rude and aggressive all the time, bullied the staff every day. I rocked it as a salesperson. I doubled my goals almost daily. Always at least met them. One day, the store manager got our numbers for the quarter. We were a little behind where we should have been, but there were also two new associates who weren’t carrying their weight. Store manager blamed me for the numbers, and accused me of giving discounts to people and allowing others to shoplift. I had never done either of those things. I was livid. So, one night with a group of 4 friends or so, one of which used to work at the store with me, we came up with a plan to raid the place to give the store manager something to actually complain about. So, I went into my shift on a Sunday morning, knowing the assistant manager would be hungover. I convinced him to take a nap out back and that I wouldn’t tell if he let me claim the sales for the day. He didn’t care about anything so it was an easy yes. Cue my friends coming in, acting as customers with their “beach bags” as I’m working with regular customers on the floor alone. A “customer” (friend) would bring their “purchase” to the counter to “ring out” and have the security tags removed and then immediately go into the changing room and bag it. Bring it to their cars, wait 20 mins, do it all over again. We all had lists of items we wanted, and I had mine piled on the counter ready to be taken. In one hour we completed the list and my friends left. The assistant manager came back from his nap oblivious, I wrapped up my shift and went home. We divided up the clothing and celebrated. Never got caught. I put my notice in the next day, and that was that. Old friend from work told me when the next quarterly report came out (after I quit) the numbers were so bad from shrink (inventory of clothing missing with no money to show for it) the store manager got demoted. Was it wrong? Yes. Would I do it again? No. Do I regret it? Not even a little bit.",LRA94,https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/e7n3q0/i_shoplifted_over_6000_worth_of_clothing_in_one/
confession,I stuck a used pad to my neighbors door to prove a point (self.confession),"My neighbors are nasty. Somehow their trash can’t stay in their outdoor bins, and they walk past their trash that’s all over the yard without a care in the world. It blows into our yard constantly. I have mentioned it before, and they claim it’s not theirs. Their bins are always open, loose trash on top, it’s so obvious it’s theirs Usually it’s just wrappers/ some sort of paper product so I just pick it up to keep the peace. However, yesterday it was a used pad. It wasn’t folded up in toilet paper, it was an open, laying flat, bloody pad laying in my front yard. I lost my shit. I triple gloved my hand, picked it up, rang her video door bell, showed her the bloody pad and told her I’m kindly returning it and stuck it to her front door. ETA: the wife hasn’t done anything but turn a snub nose at me when she walks by. Her husband and I however had a conversation. He tried to tell me it was mine and that their trash doesn’t get out of their bins. I point blank said “I don’t use pads.” And proceeded to show him the q-tips around his bins. His eyes got all big with “surprise” and he said “I’ll investigate this and get to the bottom of it.” I just replied “just pick up your trash. That’s all I ask.” He went on to move their bins into their back yard. He did not address the pad on their door. It was surprisingly cordial considering I’d just stuck a pad on their front door. I wasn’t a B, I was just stern and let him know I’m over their mess. I think I’ve made my point. But we will see if they keep their trash picked up.",Beth_Duttonn,https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1jo9lox/i_stuck_a_used_pad_to_my_neighbors_door_to_prove/
confession,I stole thousands of dollars in change over 2 years working at McDonaldsRemorse (self.confession),"When I was 16 I got a job at McDonald’s. I hated making food and working front counter. I always asked to work drive thru window taking money at the first window. This was before credit cards so everyone paid in cash. All I would do is keep a quarter or dime of almost everyone’s change I gave back. I would put that extra quarter or dime in a special spot in the register. Once I got 5 or 10 worth of change I would dump the change into the right spot and pocket a 10 or 5. Some nights I would leave with over 50 bucks in cash (a lot to a 16 year old me). No one ever caught on and only twice I can remember people telling me I gave them the wrong amount of change back. I would just act like a dumb kid whom miscounted . I don’t know how nobody at work caught on because I always had a ton of change at the end of the day. Edit 1 - I never was trying to get over on McDonald’s it was purely selfish act. Edit 2 - This is a confession, not something I’m proud of now. Edit 3 - This was 16 years ago. Yes credit card where around but not wildly used yet.

confession,I sold my bodyRemorse (self.confession),"When I turned 18 I was homeless, so for 6 months I sold body as a prostitute, to get money, to get somewhere to sleep for a night, hell even to get a shower. It was the worst time of my life. I’m a man and as a male you would think wow that’s awesome you scored so much. The complete opposite in fact every day I would see myself in the mirror and cry thinking I’m not capable of love, or even getting on my own two feet. I thought to myself I cannot afford some food for the night let alone to fall in love. Having sexual experiences with someone you do not love is the most horrible feeling ever. I don’t know about anyone else but I feel like I was somehow torturing myself. It was the hardest, most demeaning, most heart reneging thing I have ever done. Edit: I still have problems with self esteem because of this, so when my gf wants to have sex. I usually have to convince myself that she wants me for me and nothing else. Overall an 8 hour process. So I’ve decided to tell some of my friends who I don’t feel will judge me who may not know. I’ve read so much support and good vibes sent my way. Thank you all so much. UPDATE: This post was 3 years ago but everytime I remember back to that time of desperation I go back to this post and scroll down the comments. I appreciate each and every one of you, and that It really helps me each and everyday. Nothing too crazy has happened other than my gf broke up with me, but 3 whole years later and all the comments and kindness really help me learn to love myself more and more, so I thank you all. hugs",dogisgead,https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/adrzmf/i_sold_my_body/

confession,"As a child, I copied a poem from a book and won first place in a poetry contest. (self.confession)","When I was in the third grade, I was very into reading/writing and often stayed up far past my bedtime reading anything within my comprehension level that I could get my hands on. We had a stack of children’s encyclopedias I loved on all sorts of topics (dinosaurs, the planets, world history, etc) including one of stories/poems. One poem stood out in particular, it was about solitude in nature and really struck a chord with me. Because I loved the poem so much, I copied it down into a journal I had of my own writing and passages/poems I found inspiration in. Because I was so young (talking single digits here) it never occurred to me to write down the author or anything, especially not in my own journal. A few weeks went by and my mom had stumbled upon journal while cleaning my room. She read the poem and assumed it was original writing. She approached me about it that night and was so proud of it. Like any 8 year old, I wanted my mom’s approval and pride, so I didn’t tell her I had actually found the poem in a book. I didn’t think it would be a big deal, and she was so proud. Fast forward a month or two, my mom is reading the Sunday paper and sees a poetry contest for young people. She immediately thinks of “my” poem and insists I enter it. That afternoon, she had my dad drive us to his office so she could type it up (before home computers.) She sends a copy into the newspaper and, of course, because it’s an 8 year old’s name on an adult’s published poem, it wins the first prize in my age group. My parents are so happy with me and I feel so incredibly guilty. Within the next month, the poem and my picture are ran on the front page of the arts section in the paper. I am invited to read the poem as part of an award ceremony for all the contest’s participants. Of course, I go because my mom wants us to, and why wouldn’t I? I get a small award, a ribbon and maybe a gift card? I don’t remember. What I do remember is feeling so incredibly guilty. I have spent more sleepless hours over this poem than I can count. A few years later, we learn about plagiarism in school and I feel as though I’m being personally called out. I remember tearing out the book’s page with the poem, ripping it up, and throwing it away wrapped in an unused sanitary napkin because I was so afraid anyone would find out. It’s been 20 years since that award ceremony and even though I realize it was a childhood mistake that isn’t even that large, I still can’t quite shake the guilt. TL;DR - When I was 8, my mom read a poem in my journal and assumed it was original writing. I didn’t correct her, and eventually she entered it into a poetry contest. It won’t first place and I’ve been guilty for the past 20 years. Edit: Whoa! Thanks guys - you’ve honestly made me feel a little better. So many have requested the poem so I’ve posted it below. Couldn’t figure out line breaks so I’ve used slashes.

confession,I sabotaged my father's marriage because he cheated on my mother.Conflicted (self.confession),"When I was four years old my father and mother divorced because he cheated on her. They had a really rough divorce and had lots of fights. Eventually the divorce was settled and my mother and father could move on. My father married his mistress, who I'll call 'E' as to respect her privacy. My father was really happy with her and me and my sister got a stepbrother and two stepsisters with whom we got along really well. Skip forward two years and 'E' started acting different and so was my father. Me and my sister often couldn't visit our father because he had to 'work', whilst in reality he was free. When me and my sister were there we often weren't allowed to eat at the table, which seven year old me didn't understand. Eventually my father started becoming more distant, he didn't wish me happy birthday anymore and missed a lot of important milestones in my childhood, like learning to ride my bike or plays at school. When I was nine my sister and I could only visit four days a month and had to sleep in seperate rooms. I vividly remember that during one weekend that we were there I had accidentaly broken a glass and 'E' had turned furious. She send me upstairs and had me take my socks of which nine year old me found really weird. Then she showed me a piece of glass she held in her hand and said that this is what I deserved for my clumsyness. She pushed the shard of glass into the sole of my foot. I yelled and cried and tried to remove my leg from her grasp when I felt a hand on my shoulder. It was my father's hand, he was helping 'E' do this, I don't remeber what happened after that. 'E' also got into a huge fight with my sister and had pulled her by her hair down to the basement. After these two occasions and a lot of verbal abuse we decided to break all contact and tell our mother what had happened (we hadn't told her before because, well he was our father) . My mother knew this was serious abuse but she was too afraid to alert the police since my father had threatened her with violence before. Skip forward another five years, I was fourteen and a freshman at the same school my former stepsiblings attended. Once I saw them all the memories started rising again. My two stepsisters had become huge bullies and lots of people hated them. Me and a couple of friends decided to retaliate and secretly put small bags of marijuana in their backpacks. Apparently this had caused a huge fight in their home and my father and 'E' decided to divorce. After this 'E' got into serious financial troubles and my father became an alcoholic. Two weeks ago he was arrested for assault. 'E' has alledgedly become a prostitute and my former stepsiblings have been brought into protective custody. This has all been my fault, it was my idea to put the marijuana in their bags, even though they hadn't done anything to me. I ruined the lives of my stepsiblings and send my stepmother and father into a downwards-spiral. Yet in some sick way I don't feel any remorse. My sister has been dealing with a severe eating-disorder after all the verbal abuse from 'E' and has been hospitalised twice. I've tried once to commit suicide because of my sexual orientation since I thought I was an abomination after 'E''s conservative Christian rants. Now me and my sister are doing better, though we still have traumas. We've thought about starting a lawsuit but because of our ages during the incidents legal advisors have adviced us to just 'move on'. Anyway... I'm in a real moral dilemma: I did something that caused horrible things, yet I don't feel any remorse, am I a psychopath?",disgustingboots,https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/afkjte/i_sabotaged_my_fathers_marriage_because_he/
confession,My psychiatrist offered me cocaine when he didn’t recognize me as his patient (self.confession),"Alright I need to know, do you think this is morally acceptable. I am in my twenties and have struggled with depression and ADHD for a super long time. I finally agreed to see a psychiatrist that my parents recommended. He charges us like a ton of money because he did not accept our insurance. Anyways, I saw him in person for about 4-5 times. I was out at an event in our town, where there was a band playing and everyone was dancing. I was drinking beers with my friend when we saw him. “Fuck. That’s like my therapist or whatever” I say to my friend “Oh well who cares!!” She says and goes off in front of me to dance. Suddenly one of his friends is dancing with my friend and he appears closer with some other guys. “How do i know you???” The psych turns to ask me as we watch my friend start getting low , “are you guys the girls from that party last night???” “Ya??” I say half assed and joking and I go along with this. My friend returns with the guy. “Dude they were at the party last night!! Keegan’s crazy isn’t he? do you guys want to do some blow?? He pulls out a baggie of coke before we can even confirm. My friend is drunk and wants to do it and so we go near these restrooms about a couple steps to the right of us. While my friend is doing the coke he looks at me and asks me if I want some. I say “no I’m good. I don’t do coke, it makes me depressed and shit” Hoping this would trigger his memory. He grabs the bag from my friends hand and sticks his car key inside and pulls it to his nose. He takes a huge sniff and says, “you know, im a psych, you could talk to me about that” I nearly died inside. This is the first person I ever spoke about my mental health with. This guy told me that my ex boyfriend was a sex addict while he’s out here doing lines with girls that look pretty young and are drunk. I don’t know.

confession,I unknowingly did cocaine in the 4th grade. I think I was 9.No Regrets (self.confession),"During class in elementary school, a friend of mine said he had something to show me and so after school ended, we met up in the bathroom and he pulled out what looked like a golden or brass apple from his backpack. The top unscrewed and inside it was this white powder. He took a pinch and sniffed it and told me that his parents and their friends sniffed it and it made them happy. So I said okay and took a small pinch and sniffed the powder. It was bitter and burned a little but it gave me a jolt of energy. Afterwards, we went bike riding and I felt all this crazy energy. We rode and rode around for what seemed like forever at seriously top speed! But then later, we got to a hill that we couldn’t ride up because it was too steep. We walked our bikes. The sun beat down on us and I suddenly felt tired. Then I felt this pain in my head. It was the first time, I tried cocaine and also the first time, I ever got a headache. I told my friend about the pain and he showed me a pressure point on my hand and to this day, every time I get a headache, I use that pressure point on my hand.

confession,"I made my “own” money at home, and amazingly it worked. (self.confession)","Somewhere north of 20 years ago, I got some instruction on how coin operated vending machines accurately counted the coins you put in, and why it was kind of hard to trick them. I was fascinated, and wanted to know how the newer (at the time) bill accepting machine worked. I was told that that info was secret because if you knew how, it was pretty easy to fool the machines. Keep in mind this was probably around 2000 or so, I assume the machines are better now. Anyways, this fascinated me. It was before YouTube so I couldn’t just go look it up, but I started just looking at the bills I had. One thing i noticed was that (with Canadian bills back then, maybe still) each bill was slightly different sized. All the $5 were the same, but different from the $10’s and so on. Boredom and a lack of fore thought got the better of me and I tinkered. I had an old color scanner, and a beater ink jet printer. I scanned and printed both sides of some bills, and carefully glued-stick’d the sides together, and then cut them to the exact size of the real bill. I did that with a $5 and a $10. For shits and giggles, I went to an automated car wash and put one of my bogus bills in the change machine. Bzzzt… the machine spit it back out. I noticed that a corner was bent, so I straightened it, and fed the bill the opposite way. Cling ka-cling ka-cling ka-cling cling… as $5 worth of quarters dumped out. Holy shit. It worked! I tried the $10… Cling ka-cling ka-cling ka-cling cling… this time forty quarters dumped out. I looked around, realized what I had just done and panicked. I left the car wash immediately, and then drove home. At home, I couldn’t believe what had just happened. And then all of sudden I couldn’t not try to replicate it. I made another $10 and a $20 and went to a different gas station. Cling ka-cling ka-cling ka-cling cling… as $10 worth of quarters dumped out. Again. At a different change machine. Holy crap. This is real. Then I tried the $20 bill… Bzzzt… The bogus bill came back out. I tried again. Bzzzt… No go once again. One more time: Bzzzt… No such luck. It didn’t like the $20, but the $5 and $10 seemed to be a lock. Then it started to get stupid. I told a friend of mine about what I’d done, and almost instantly we started making plans to become big time counterfeiters. We started figuring out where to go, how to avoid camera, etc. Then I finally came to my senses. This is fucking stupid. What do we do with shit tonnes of quarters? Do I really want to end up in jail for this? I called it quits, and that was it. I still don’t know why it worked. Was it the size? It wasn’t the quality of the bills; you couldn’t fool a blind person with them. Maybe it was just the machines were hot garbage, I don’t know. But I guarantee you, I got $25.00 worth of quarters by exchanging my dog shit faux bills in a change machine.",phalangepatella,https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1jsbwxq/i_made_my_own_money_at_home_and_amazingly_it/

confession,I accidentally killed my pet mouse last night and I can't get over it.Remorse (self.confession),"My boyfriend and I owned two mice. However, they were both male so obviously they'd get into little fights and whenever things got bad we took the black one out because he had the mentality the whole cage was just his. This is the mouse I accidentally killed because he had begun to fight over food (even though we have two separate bowls of food for them) so I decided to go and bring out the black one to calm them both down. Well when I grabbed him he bit me pretty hard and everything happened so fast. My reflexes squeezed as he bit me and then he fell when my hand opened really fast after that. At first I didn't understand what happened but his legs weren't working and I realized he made a 'pop' feel in my hand. I started crying and woke my boyfriend up and after he took the mouse I laid down and cried. I couldn't stop crying. How could I do something like that? Yeah he was a pain in the a when he started the fights but he was the first mouse my boyfriend and I got. He ended up dying a 20 minute death because me squeezing him crushed his lungs and he suffocated. I just couldn't stop crying the whole night and couldn't believe that happened to me. Now our other mouse has no company and I feel so bad. We ended up giving his body to a snake owner to at least purpose his death. I watched him struggle in his last moments. I held him as he began going limp and I held his lifeless body. I dunno when I'll get over this or if I can. Everyone keeps telling me it's okay but I killed a creature I was supposed to help care for and I failed him. I'm so sorry. I also think my boyfriend kinda doesn't mind this happened because this mouse was such an a he never really seemed to like us and often only pissed us off but still he was our mouse and I killed him. EDIT: Nabisco's death didn't get bad until his last minutes. My boyfriend comforted him the entire time and encouraged me to say goodbye. I cried so hard I couldn't even speak I'm sorry to him I wish I were small enough to hug him in those moments. I knew he didn't deserve this no matter how mean he was at times. I still loved coming after classes and work to see our two mice. I didn't squeeze Nabisco until he popped. My hand squeezed hard and fast at the same time that resulted in his injury. lol DOUBLE EDIT: Thank you to everyone who has told similar stories and posted comforting comments. I've been crying to them because of how nice most people have been. It's been helping me a lot to feel better and know I'm not alone.

confession,"I used to charge a kid a made up ""fat tax"" (self.confession)","A long time ago I was a high schooler at a boarding school. I was a decent kid in the eyes of the teachers and school administration. In fact they liked me so much that throughout my time there I was able to rise through the student ranks. I became a prefect, then I became the Head Boy, and at one point I had passed training that allowed me to run my own sports sessions or event where I was supervising younger and even a few older kids. This was just basic training for first aid, situational awareness, etc. At one point the school had so much trust in me that I was allowed to leave the school premises alone in the afternoons. This was huge and very few students had this privilege. In typical fashion, as soon as I received the privilege I began abusing my powers as a free man. The school was very adamant on getting us balanced meals so we weren't allowed to get food delivered (all delivery vehicles were refused entrance). Having the privilege of leaving the premises meant that I didn't have to order junk food and risk getting caught, I could simply go out to any fast food joint and bring food back with me. It all started out as an exclusive club, myself and my friends were munching on McDonald's and KFC as the plebians were having the filthy healthy cafeteria foods. Then I was offered something I couldn't refuse, MONEY. Not long after I had built a whole operation for bootlegging junk food into the school. We had cut off times for orders, a priority list for regular customers, extra fees for late orders, and even a spreadsheet for keeping a record of orders, payments, and profits. This smuggling was next level, we were organised, knew all the fire exits, where to walk to avoid corridor cameras, and how to pack the food so that it's unnoticeable when walking in (mostly used sports bags with a thin layer of clothes). The teachers new something was going on, there was food wrappers everywhere but no one knew how it came in. Business was booming and I was making profits of 50 dollars a day, for 3-4 days a week. But it wasn't enough, I was hungry for more. There was a fat kid that ordered regularly, so I pulled the most asshole move you could do to your best customer. I started charging 2x the price for his orders and I would hide behind a bullshit moral barrier claiming we were doing this for his own good since we learned in economics that increased prices reduce demand and so he would be eating less and he would lose weight. The kid saw straight through the BS but in the end he couldn't resist it and continued ordering from me.

confession,A year ago I relapsed on heroin and recovered. I never told my wife or kids. (self.confession),"I have a wife and 2 kids, aged 14 and 11. I was a heroin addict from 16 years old to 23 years old, which was when my first son was born. My wife helped me get sober, and remains an amazing person and wife overall. Last year, my wife had surgery and got pain pills. I don't know what the fuck came over me, but I just wanted to try one to remember how good opiates feel. I was thinking, it wasnt heroin right? So maybe I wont relapse? I cant even describe how stupid of a decision it was. I wasn't depressed, or particularly yearning for heroin, but I just wanted to try it. Literally right away it felt so unbelievably amazing that I took 2 more the next day. On day 3 I took about 4-5, I was high the entire day, feeling absolutely amazing. By day 5, I went to one of the local dealers and got heroin. Literally only took me 5 days to get back on heroin. My wife never got a hint. My kids never suspected anything. I was lucky this happened while my wife was recovering from her surgery, she was bed ridden most of the day so I was mostly free to do what I want. I didn't inject, I just snorted. I did it every single day for 2 weeks. The only suspicion was my daughter saying I was acting weird when I was high and when my son went downstairs at night and I was mumbling because I was nodding out. He just assumed I was tired. I knew I had to do something. I wanted to just leave, run away to new mexico or something and just do heroin the entire time, then maybe come back. At the time it was literally all I wanted, I kept making these horrible, immoral excuses for my usage. Like oh, my kids are old enough, and my wife is a good mom, they dont even need me! I can just run away and do heroin on an island forever. That was the kind of shit I would think. I knew it was bullshit, but its so damn powerful. I ended up quitting. I just sort of forced myself to stop, which previously when I was a teen seemed impossible, but now it feels like I have more to live for. Its been a whole year since then.

confession,[No regrets] I conned my way into being a therapistTough Love (self.confession),"While on a plane a few months ago, a depressed business man that was sitting right next to me started talking about his problems and how he failed to find a good therapist. 'I would pay a fortune just to find a good one' he said before asking me what do I do. Yeah, you guessed what I answered. After that he asked me if I accept bitcoin and if we can do it remotely on the phone. 'Even better', I thought, just like that guy from 'Catch me if you can'. After our first calls, the guy was so impressed with me, he told his friend about me. I was now dealing with 2 clients and the guilt started to creep in. After a month or so of 'therapy', I confessed to them both. They didn't care. 'You're the best', they said. My secret? I'm a hard core misanthrope. And oddly enough, this makes them extremely comfortable. Nothing is too shameful to share (I already assume the worst about people), I look at life from the perspective of a detached observer (I'm objective in my analysis), I am a great listener (I barely talk, because I know that what they need is to vent, not to ask for solutions), I am well read, I traveled the world, I made money etc (I can empathize with whatever they are talking about), I like listening (I find it very educational) and I sell no BS (I'm way to pessimistic for that sh*t).

confession,I Use my Roommates Face Towel to Clean Up His Pee. He Still Hasn't Noticed.Conflicted (self.confession),"I go to college in midwest United States. I live in a dorm an have a roommate who shares a bathroom with me. He's not from the United States and seems a little nervous to talk to anybody who isn't from his home country. The first few weeks of college, I started to notice pee on the toilet seat. No big deal, I cleaned it up. After about the 10th time, I asked him if he could stop peeing on the toilet seat, or if he does, wipe it up. He said okay and went on his day. About 3 months later, I started to notice pee all over the floor, toilet seat, and all around the toilet; worse than before. I used my own toilet paper and started going through it very quickly, so it was getting expensive. I ended up walking over to his side of the counter and grabbing one of his extra towels. I've been using it to clean pee for about 1 month now and I've definitely noticed a change in color due to the urine and the fact that I've never seen him wash it. I feel bad about it, but what he's doing is disgusting and I've tried to tell him to stop many times. Should I feel sorry and stop?

However she goes into crazy detail about her personal life, how people treat her and how she treats people. I've been working there nearly two years and it's ranged from her boyfriend, his son and other things. Her now fiance has a son, who he had from a previous relationship. Let's call my coworker Linda for ease. Linda knew this before getting in a relationship with him. A lot of their arguments stem from him having a child from a previous relationship. Recently she has started telling me about how she gives out and has no patience for his little boy. He's 6, he is a child. The most recent vent of hers that resulted in me being quite blunt with her. Apparently she had left the room for about 30 mins and left her food on the bed, her fiancé's little boy went in and started to play Xbox, got hungry and ate the food.. Linda came back and see's red, immediately starts screaming at him. Then she gets really nasty and tells him that everytime he's here he's a fucking issue and she just can't get enough space from him. I don't know everything that was said but she always talks about how she doesn't want him in the room a lot of the time despite that he only visits on weekends. I snapped, I told her she needs to grow the fuck up and do better. I told her she knew he had a child and chose to get in a relationship with him. That it's not the child's fault that you disagree with your fiancé's previous choices. The kids mother isn't nice either, so he has it hard enough there too. I told her she has an opportunity to not only be a great mother but also a great step mother to that child. What will happen when you birth your baby if you're already treating him like this? I said she doesn't get to scream and shout at an innocent child because she can't handle her emotions and no matter how bad she feels about it she deserves it and needs to feel it... I have no sympathy for her, she comes in saying this that and the other about how bad she feels after doing it. But keeps doing it. She's been giving me the silent treatment for like two days.

confession,I lied about my age when i was 16 when I rented my 1st apartment and it kind of snowballed from there. (self.confession),"Editing to say: This post was ended abruptly and is giving ""woe is me"" at the end - I'm only seeing it now - that was/is not the vibe i have towards this ""era"" or the choices I made during it. I'm genuinely grateful - and i suppose it more so shaped me than fucked me up . When I was 16 I left foster care, dropped out of school and got a full time job . At this ft job I met this guy who I became friends with. This guy was also looking for an apartment . So we decided to be roommates. I wanted to be on the lease with him - my friend - so I lied about my age. Well this friend was about 6 yrs older than me when he thought it was only 2 ... it wasnt long before we started being intimate with one another, and I met all his friends. Who happened to be about 10 yrs older than HIM... I ended up hanging with all these people going to bars with them doing drugs with then, partying, living with, cheated on him with .... and they had no idea I was absolute jail bait. I feel awful about it today. I was like 16 and 17 and they had no idea.

confession,My sister and I swap places Even though we aren't twins. (self.confession),"My sister and I swap places all the time. We aren't even twins, we are two and a half years apart. But we both have brown hair, brown eyes, medium build, similar faces. We're apparently alike enough that people don't question it, or just think they're crazy. I have even attended doctor appointments for her because she forgot to cancel and couldn't pay the cancelation fee. (Obviously not blood work/tests) and her routine doctor didn't say anything to me about it. I also showed a house to a sort of family friend for her, and just answered all the questions as if I was her. She has also taken my kids to places for me, and just pretended to be me and non of the parents acted like it was strange. Our husbands think what we're doing is a little wrong, but sometimes being in two places at once it's just so convenient.",CoffeeMuenster,https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1ka3krs/my_sister_and_i_swap_places_even_though_we_arent/
confession,I tried to miscarry my baby and hurt her permanently (self.confession),"When I was 15, I got myself pregnant unintentionally. I was a very promiscuous horny teenager and I wasn't exactly safe about it. Sometimes I used condoms, sometimes I didn't. I got really worried when I started experiencing the usual symptoms of morning headaches and nausea and skipped my period, so I took a pregnancy test and what I feared was true, I was pregnant. I had no idea how to react to this. For one I was utterly terrified and I wanted to get rid of it. In a way it felt parasitic, the thing inside me with the power to fuck my life up. I have very Christian parents who would have disowned me for having an abortion, but I knew they would actually love to raise this kid. However, I hated the idea. I had problems with eating at the time and didn't want to gain the pregnancy weight and I just didn't want a child. I guess I'm making excuses, even now. I started a smoking habit very promptly, since I'd heard in science lessons that one of the effects of smoking can be miscarriage. I barely ate at all, and if I did I threw it up, all in the hopes of starving it as if I was trying to get rid of a fever. It didn't work. I gave birth to her far too early and as a result she is blind. I gave her away and haven't heard from her since, she's 8 by now. My parents were surprisingly supportive and I got the help I needed for my eating disorder and I still go to regular therapy. I just had to get it off my chest. Edit: I've realised now that this confession has come across as unremorseful. It was hard writing it, and as a result I focused more on what happened than my emotions. I want to make it clear that I really really regret my actions. It's very hard to live with what I've done, and when I was 17 I attempted suicide because I simply couldn't handle it any longer. What I've done to my child tears me apart every day. I still have nightmares, I still can't sleep at night. I can't tell you how many times I've wished and prayed to go back in time. However, I've focused on improving myself through therapy and I am training to be a nurse to help children. I know that doesn't make up for it, but I'm trying hard to be better. Edit 2: This is NOT the way to deal with this situation. First of all, always always always use contraception unless you are willing to accept the responsibility of a child, which is a life long commitment. If you're a woman, don't trust the man to bring it each time and keep it in a safe, secure location. Bring your own condoms, get on the pill, get an implant, whatever works for you. If you do get pregnant, don't be afraid to reach out for help. Speak to your doctor or teacher you world. If you feel like you can't talk to your parents, but if you do think you can speak to them don't feel ashamed. Don't do what I did. Getting pregnant is not the end of the world. Don't let it be the end of yours.

confession,I guess I am my brothers keeperNo Regrets (self.confession),"I used to watch over my little brother (who at the time we didn’t know has aspergers) when he was at school. Kids would always pick on him and when he came home with bruises, I ditched school (I was in high school and he was in middle school) and snuck onto campus during recess and lunch times, but always stayed a ways away. I saw some little asshat push my brother down and watched as he got back up, picked up his books and walked away, even though the boy was following him and smacking the back of his head. After my brother made it into the classroom, I ran up, grabbed the kid by the back of the neck and without thinking, head butted him. Once he started to cry, I pulled him in and told him if he ever lays a hand on that little boy again, I’d break every last one of his sad little bones. I’ve never told anyone about doing that. After school, I watched my brother begin to walk home and the little shits friend walked up to him, yelled something about “Some dumb older girl” (I can only assume he meant me) and he pushed my brother into the street and a car had to slam on its breaks to avoid hitting him. At that point, I LOST it. I pulled my brother onto the sidewalk, made sure he was okay and told him not to move. I ran over to the little shit (I didn’t care that he was younger. Not ONE BIT), grabbed him by his hair and yanked him to the ground and started beating the ever loving crap out of him. At some point, I broke his arm. The driver of the car that almost hit my brother had called the police and pulled me off of him, but backed me up 100% and told the officer the truth about what he saw. I got INSANELY lucky. The police officer told me he has a little sister with autism and he probably would have done the same thing. Didn’t even get punished in the slightest, was just told to take my brother home and to promise never to hit anyone again. (The best I could give was to never get caught hitting anyone again). We stopped by the 7/11 on the way home and I got us both some ice cream. I don’t know if he remembers that day now but I’d still do it all over again in a heartbeat.",MissTreated42,https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/7wfgui/i_guess_i_am_my_brothers_keeper/
confession,I lied to get revenge on a rude passenger and when I walk around I still think about it... (self.confession),"I have a little secret I’ve never told anyone. It might sound stupid or even funny, but it makes me feel really guilty. I travel a lot, sometimes for work, sometimes for holidays. I fly so often that I occasionally recognize the same flight attendants on certain airlines. They probably don’t recognize me, but that’s not really important. One thing I’ve noticed at airports is how people queue up 20+ minutes before boarding even starts. Since I travel a lot, I usually just sit and wait until the crowd thins out. No rush, no holding anyone back, just avoiding the unnecessary stress. Anyway, one day while I was waiting, I noticed a middle-aged woman aggressively pushing her way through the queue, claiming she’d been there first. Picture this: fake blonde hair, Louis Vuitton bags, chin held high like royalty, shoving people aside without even a “sorry” or “excuse me.” Sadly, not the first time I’ve seen that kind of entitlement. But what really got to me was when she used her foot to move a child (probably 6 or 7 years old) out of her way, like he was some inanimate object. That stuck with me. Fast forward to boarding the plane: guess who’s sitting in the window seat I specifically paid for? I didn’t want to cause a scene, but I calmly told the flight attendant that she was in my seat and the lady was being difficult with me. Before the attendant could even say anything, the woman exploded, accusing me of lying, yelling that she got there first and nobody told her otherwise. I just stood there with a confused look, letting her dig her own grave. She kept escalating, eventually insulting the flight attendant and making threats. In the end, she was escorted off the plane. People actually clapped. But here’s the thing: I lied. I never interacted with the lady. I just… wanted a small, petty bit of revenge for the way she treated that kid. And now I can’t stop thinking about it. I know people have bad days. Maybe she was going through something awful. But because of me, she missed her flight, and I happen to know she had to wait two whole days for the next one. I don’t want sympathy. I’m not looking for validation. I just needed to let this out. Maybe now, when I walk around thinking about it, I’ll feel a little lighter.",Nairvart,https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1l26xgn/i_lied_to_get_revenge_on_a_rude_passenger_and/
confession,"I changed my grade senior year of high school, with the principal in the room.Light (self.confession)","It was senior year of high school, and we were doing a partnered assignment in environmental science, tracking the river behind the school to find its source. There was an odd number of students and I was okay with working alone. That day the principal was “observing” the teacher, evaluating her performance. My teacher trusted me, and gave me her laptop to do the assignment, and asked if I would show the principal what we were doing. I agreed and quickly finished my assignment. The principal and teacher were standing by the door chatting, so I open the PowerSchool app. There it is... all my friends grades, including mine, staring at me in an excel style format. I notice copious amounts of 0’s by my name, dragging my grade down somewhere in the low 70’s. (I was a minimal effort high schooler) I quickly changed most of the 0’s to 70’s or 60’s. This way it wouldn’t look too suspicious. My heart was racing as I saved the updated grades, and I didn’t tell anyone for a few years including my best friend/ brother.

confession,I spammed a coworker with email read receipts for three weeks. Always the same email. (self.confession),"Years ago I found a way to trigger multiple email read receipts for the same email. We can disable read receipts at work. I had a coworker who insisted that he receive one so he knows that we read his emails. He was such a pain that our manager told us to turn off the block. After much trial and error I found that if you put an unread email into a folder on your desktop and make copies of it then each one you open will send a new read receipt. I sent him a couple dozen right away. He asked me why he's receiving so many of them for the same email. I said that I have no idea what he is talking about. I only opened the email, replied, then deleted it. A few days later I sent him more, always the same email. He only got one read receipt from me for every other email. He asked me again. I played dumb. Over the next few weeks I would open more. Sometimes only one, sometimes more than 50. It was always a random number. I would just put them into a folder and open them all at once. He was getting increasingly frustrated, insisting that I was doing it on purpose, and called IT. IT was very curious and called to talk to me. They wanted to look at my laptop. I confessed to them what I was doing and why. I told them I had my fun and I'll stop. They closed the ticket with a generic response saying the issue is resolved and recommended we disable read receipts, which we did. I was really worried about losing my job because technically I was wasting time, harassing my coworker, and intentionally stressing him out.

confession,"In High School, I forged all of my report cards (self.confession)","Back in high school, I wasn't a great student and report cards always got me in a lot of trouble. Around the 9th grade I started intercepting the mail, scanning in my report card on my windows PC, then carefully changing all the grades and comments from my teachers using text & numbers that were already on the page. Afterward, I'd very carefully print it out so everything was in the correct spots, then folded it up and put it back in the envelope. At one point in time, my mother was corresponding with one of my teachers via email to track my progress.

confession,I threw eggs from the 16th floor of my apartment to maintain peace and quiet. (self.confession),I used to live on the 16th floor of an apartment building. There was a pub on the ground floor and people would often congregate late at night in the street in front of the pub entrance. This was a hinderance to residents because we would wake up at 1 or 2 in morning to drunk people talking outside. My apartment had 2 balconies on 2 sides of the building so I often looked down on people grouping together on both sides of the building. I got fed up with it and decided to drop an egg where a group of people were chatting. They immediately dispersed and i could enjoy my sleep again I did this on another occasion and again it worked. I started buying more eggs and it became a habit that I practiced for about 6 months. No one had a clue it was me and I even went to the pub and over heard people chatting about eggs being dropped from balconies in the building.

confession,I framed my mother's ex husband when I was 5Light (self.confession),"So, for a little background, my moms ex husband was a jerk. Later on in life, I found out that he was even worse than I thought, but even to 5 year old me, he was a jerk. For example, there was one summer that he spent all of our money (meaning his and the money from the THREE jobs my mom worked at the time) on cigarettes and booze and other dumb shit, leading to me and my sister having to spend the summer at my grandmother's because there was literally no food in the house and my mom had to live off of bread and butter for about 3 months. He was that kind of guy. So, when I was a kid, I always got up much much earlier than everyone else. I can't remember why, but it was probably just so I could watch cartoons in peace. One morning, I went into the living room to find this dudes pocket knife on the couch. It was closed, but i got curious. I opened it and I was playing with it, when I had a thought. Obviously I can't remember the actual train of thought, but it led to me deciding to cut my hand, right in the center of my palm, so that mom would be mad at Meat-Head-Mcdonald. I immediately started bleeding, and a lot. (Now, I know that I bled so much bc I have a blood clotting disorder, yay me) I started screaming, mom came down the stairs along with Dick-Wipe, and they saw what happened. I told mom that he had left the knife open on the couch arm, and I had put my hand down on it on accident. This led to one of their biggest fights, with mom saying that he was endangering me, and Micro-Penis saying he swore he didn't leave it open. So yeah. I still have the lovely scar on the middle of my hand to remind me that I was more of an evil genius when I was a child than I ever will be again. Fun.

confessions,I've manipulated my husband by strategically sleeping with him for more than 20 years (self.confessions),"I've been married for going on 30 years. Many, many years ago I realized that on the weekends if I got up in the morning and did whatever I needed to do (made breakfast, took care of kids, cleaned, etc) my husband would just stay in bed all day and watch TV. If I wanted to take the kids somewhere, or suggested we go shopping or hiking or hang out with friends or literally anything, my husband would say he's worked hard all week and he wants to just relax, so we'd do nothing all weekend long. BUT if I started the morning by sleeping with him, shortly after we were done he'd get up and take a shower and be ready to go conquer the world. So if I want to have a lazy day at home, I get up and do whatever I want. But if I want to go do something, I sleep with him first thing in the morning.

confessions,Mother breaks down at dinner and confesses the horrifying truth of the missing bear. (self.confessions),"This is a confession to me from my mother. So.... many years ago I was sat round the dinner table with my mum and she broke down in hysterical laughter, tears and all, and told me she had something to tell me, she couldn’t live with the lie anymore. When I was a little girl I used to have a child sized bear, (originally named big bear) who lived under my bed to protect me from monsters etc. I loved this bear. He was my protector and my best friend. My mum however HATED this bear. In her mind he was one of those cheap bears you can win at the fairground stuffed full of straw, but to me he was perfect. When I was eight years old we moved house and during this move Big Bear went missing... believed stolen. My parents assured me that they had contacted the police and they were on the case. Eventually time passed and I forgot about big bear and life moved on. Coincidentally, at the same time of big bears mysterious disappearances, I was in my school play ‘teddy bears tea party’ and my role was teddy bear number two. My costume was amazing. It was a hand made, full zip up teddy bear costume, complete with a cute little bonnet with pink bow. I was the cutest teddy bear in the whole show (confirmed by grandparents). Now you’ve probably guessed the terrible secret that my mother has carried with her all these years.... My amazingly cute teddy bear costume WAS BIG BEAR. She had murdered him, pulled out his insides, and cut off his head. She then cut off his face, attached a bow to his head and made me wear his cold... dead.... very cute and fluffy teddy bear skin. I think she finally caved and confessed because she could no longer live with the guilt. I was and still am traumatised. RIP Big Bear.

confessions,I married rich...and it's awesome. (self.confessions),"I met my wife when she was a grad student, and while I was impressed by how put together her apartment was, this was before I personally owned a table so it didn't take much to intimidate me. Things went well, I proposed, and during the engagement she shared with me that her family had a considerable amount of wealth. Not fuck you money, certainly, but enough that we essentially will never need to worry about most financial concerns as long as we don't flip out and start buying tigers or something. Obviously this has changed my life. I'm about to finish my professional degree with no student debt, having spent the last four years living in nice homes near the beach while my classmates pack into dingy apartments together. We're purchasing a starter home that's nicer than my parent's, with a guaranteed loan of whatever we need. I realized I don't watch the register at the grocery store because it doesn't matter if I spent sixty or eighty dollars, and I rarely hesitate before mashing the amazon buy now button. I'm grateful that my wife grew up without money and that we're both pretty frugal by temperament, but I gotta imagine we're both changed simply by not having the stress of financial worry. Bottom line though, being rich is awesome. I sort of knew that, I guess, but the awesome goes all the way down.

I would prefer not to give the field of work as it’s fairly specific. 70k a year, benefits, whole nine yards. Really awesome. The confession is that all of my info is pulled from standard excel files made by other people. In my first month I made a macro that pulls from 50+ places on our shared drive and compiles a 5 page report daily. The email sends itself at random times around 2:30 every day Monday-Friday. Everyone thinks I’m amazing at my job. I’m the laziest fuck you’ll ever meet. I’m almost done getting a VPN function approved that will allow me to work from home. Edit because this blew up way more than I thought: This is a throwaway so no worries about my boss finding out. A lot of questions about what I’m doing with my time. I’ve actually done a program through work that allows me to get my education for free. I have my masters now and am working on some other things. A lot of positive comments about working smart, not hard. Much appreciated. How long did it take me to figure it out? Did the old way for 2 weeks before I realized what I could do. Took another week of doing the report while working on the macro. Then a week of troubleshooting. So about a month after I started, it became automated. And people have asked about vacations/sick days. I have a work laptop so sick days are not an issue (although I think I’ve called in twice in 10 years). Vacations I just disable it. Simple. Small funny story on this topic; when we had our first child, he came 3 weeks early. I was so caught up that I completely forgot about the email otherwise I would have disabled it.

(self.confessions)","My husband and I have been together for 3yrs, married for 2..I found out recently that he's been talking to, and planning meet ups with his ex behind my back. He tells me very little about his talks with her, if he tells me at all. I found out by accident, and now, I check almost daily to see the extent of his conversations with her. He doesn't know that I know they're talking. I have screen shots and pictures of the conversations, which I plan to use when I leave. Father's Day is coming up, and I plan to make it the best he's ever had, then leave the next day while he's at work. All of our family pictures will be replaced with photos of their conversations, a copy of the divorce papers will be on the coffee table, and I will be long gone. I have busted my ass off to help build a life that this man wants, and he goes behind my back, then lies to me about it. I'm done, and I've had enough. Am I the asshole? Probably.

confessions,I've lost all respect for my Girlfriend. (self.confessions),"So I tried climbing a small mountain with her as sort of a fun date activity. Not even 100 yards from the summit she sits down and refuses to go to the top, which was an easy stroll away, so I ended up going alone. This has become a metaphor for our relationship in a way. I want to start something, she goes along with it but never commits, and expects me to finish everything without her. In addition, she refuses to get a real job (she claims she has a job, but makes less than $400 a month). We don't plan on having kids (I don't want any), but she seems to think she'll still be able to sit around at home all day with her computer and leave me to work my ass off and support her dreams, but at the same time she won't push her limits. She also refuses to drive, and I act as her taxi service, and I do most of the cooking, cleaning, and shopping. She mostly wants to watch movies, play games, screw, and go out. (for some people, an active sex life and shared interests is all they want in a relationship, but I can't afford to support her, nor do I want to.) We've been dating for two years now. We get along well as far as interests and hobbies, but it's becoming clear that if I take things to the next step she'll be more of a hindrance than a help, so I haven't been able to bring myself to commit to marriage, and I don't think she'll ever change her ways, and I'm tired of being alone on top of the mountain.",crazyfoxguy,https://old.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/b560k5/ive_lost_all_respect_for_my_girlfriend/
confessions,I made a facebook meme page in high school that got the police involved (self.confessions),"When I was in high school I created a meme page that made fun of every teacher, student and faculty there (some of them were extremely offensive and were basically attacks on individuals). I just kept doing them for the lolz. Once the administration got a hold of it they hired a private investigator to find the culprit. Luckily I wasn't that stupid so I made and uploaded all my memes from the library computer. I started making memes making fun out of the shitty administration and the investigation which then escalated into a whole chase for me with the police involved. They threatened legal action but since they couldn't find me I just kept memeing my way through high school. During my graduation day, I posted one final meme that said that I just graduated and that the search teams sucked ass. I think at that point they had an idea it was me but they never proved it. It feels good to finally let it out haha. I never told anyone out of fear for snitches",jovany08,https://old.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/az8v53/i_made_a_facebook_meme_page_in_high_school_that/
confessions,I fathered a child for my high school sweetheart and her lesbian wife. Nobody but us three know. (self.confessions),"I am a 40 year old male. My ex gf from high school has been married for years to her wife and they approached me about being a sperm donor. I had just broken up with my gf and really gave it some deep thought. I've been close to her since high school and we even thought about giving it another try about 5 years ago but it didn't pan out. I broke up with my girlfriend at the time and during that time is when I went to my exs house and we tried on two different occasions to inseminate at home with an at home kit they had purchased. I had read that it's illegal in some states but we tried it anyway and well it worked. Her wife was pregnant with a boy and she gave birth a year ago today. He looks like me and her wife obviously but I guess it just feels different now that I know he's out there. They have offered for me to see him in person. They said I'd be considered an ""uncle"" to the child until he asks more about his father in the future. My family would be pissed and so would alot of people on both sides if they knew but I just have a good feeling about it and he seems to be very happy.

confessions,My son got gang raped at college (self.confessions),My son went away to college for his freshman year and came back an absolute mess. I thought he couldn't handle living on campus. He dropped out and that led to a lot of tension and a few shoving matches. Things got worse when he became anorexic and had to be hospitalized. He finally disclosed to me why he deteriorated after coming home from college - he got raped by three men. There was a girl offering nonsexual modeling work for guys at his college. He inquired about it and was offered $1000 cash to do shirtless photos at a pool. They'd be other guys and girls from his school there too. A guy picked him up and took him to an apartment with two other guys. They said they were waiting for everyone else to show up and for the house to be set up. They offered my son a drink and he got sick. The three guys the took turns raping him. He said they didn't use condoms and a few times he tried to fight back but couldn't stay awake. He woke up at a park. He wasn't robbed or beaten. Just raped. The apartment was an Airbnb rental and the numbers he got had been disconnected. He was furious that he had been taken advantage of and ashamed that he couldn't tell anyone. He spent the last year getting better and is going to a college in our area so he can live at home. My point to all this is that rape is not just a female thing. My son said nothing because he was convinced that people would shame and blame him. Edit: My son did not want to report it because he is ashamed by it. He thinks people will frown upon him.,SatisfactionHot3563,https://old.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/x44bqd/my_son_got_gang_raped_at_college/
confessions,"My wife died earlier this year.

In reality, she was in the hospital for nearly a week. But she hated people seeing her when she was ‘’weak’ and begged me not to tell anyone - and then a day later she wasn’t lucid enough to change her mind I couldn’t betray her, not when I figured she would be up in a few days and angry at me for telling. I told work I had COVID so I couldn’t come to the office, and worked from home or the hospital. She’d been laid off recently with all the layoffs happening and had been quiet while recovering from it so no one suspected anything. She was even in the hospital during my birthday, but I just posted on social media a pic of her present (neither of us were the type to wait til the day of to hand it over so I already had it) and no one questioned it. I sat through the worst conversations of my life with the doctors alone. But I truly didn’t believe she was going to die. She was young. We had time. I was wrong.

confessions,At my previous job I slept in my car outside the building where I worked for six months to avoid my long commute. It absolutely changed my life for the better. (self.confessions),"WARNING: Long story After I graduated college in June 2018, I moved back home with my parents. I had no job prospects upon graduation nor did I have any relevant experience or decent connections. All I had was an Econ degree and a 2.8 GPA, considering I wanted to go into finance, I was pretty fucked. Eventually two months later, after hundreds of rejected applications and five failed interviews, I got an offer. It was for an accounts payable role paying $15.87/hour at a big company. The office was in a city 45 miles from my home in a city with a very high cost of living. Despite the commute and low salary I took the job. I didn't really have much choice. I had student loans to pay off and I was naive and desperate. And I figured since it was a big firm if I worked hard and got to know the right people, I could land myself a better position later on. The commute was terrible. I started work at 9 am and was done at 6 pm. If I left my house at 6-7 am, it still took me two hours to get to the office. Going home was just as bad. If I got home earlier than 8 pm, I considered that a good day. I spent about 4 hours+ each day in my car. I was also driving a small SUV so gas was rough. After six months I was ready to crack. I would come to work already drained and coming home I just didn't have the energy or time for any hobbies. All I would do is watch tv or play video games. The job was dead end; what I was mostly doing was data entry, I hadn't learned anything of value to me professionally. Also a large portion of my salary was going to gas. And I was gaining weight from eating fast food after work. Moving to the city was not an option due to the area I worked in being very expensive. Then one day I was having lunch with my coworker and we were discussing his upcoming vacation plans. His plan was he was going to drive to the office the next week, work the whole day and then uber to the airport from the office. I was confused, what about his car? My coworker was surprised and he told me as we were employees we were allowed to leave our cars overnight in our office parking structure for as long as we wanted. All we had to do was sign a document saying if anything happened to our car the company wasn't responsible. It was a common thing since the office was close to the airport and it was more convenient to just uber. And right there, everything changed. At that point for the next six months this was my routine: Every Sunday I would pack my clothes and meal prep for the week and drive down to my office that night since traffic was much lighter. My office was accessible 24/7, so I would come in and store all food in the refrigerators. My office also had a 24/7 onsite gym with showers so I would go there, shower and brush my teeth. I would then go to my car parked all the way at the top of the structure. I'd roll down the windows slightly for air and then put up my windshield cover. My car had very dark tints so I never had need to cover my windows. I then would go to sleep. Luckily with an SUV, I had plenty of leg room. Monday morning I would wake up at 7 am, go to the gym and get a workout in. I'd brush my teeth and shower and get into the office by 8:30. I was never ever late again. I'd work until 6 pm and then eat my dinner I stocked in the fridge. Once I was done with work, I would stay at the office (it was common for people to work late so no one ever batted an eye at me) and look up tutorials on certain skills I wanted to gain. I learned advance excel, financial modeling, certain softwares, etc. Then at around 9-10 pm, I would go back to the gym, shower and brush my teeth and go sleep in my car. I would repeat this the rest of the week until Friday when I drove home. I improved significantly. Meal prepping healthy food and working out allowed me to get back into shape. I was getting around 8-9 hours of sleep per night, so I was much better rested and more productive during the day. I was able to learn skills that were relevant to me and I had slightly better social life in the city I was in since I no longer worried about my commute. I was also driving less, so I was spending less on gas. I also managed to pay off my loans and help my parents out since I was able to save so much. Nobody knew about this. I would tell my parents I was staying with a friend who charged me cheap rent for staying the week. Since I worked for a big company in a minor role, no one really knew or cared who I was. Not once was my car ever ticketed or towed nor did anyone ever investigate my car at night. This went on until I resigned two months ago. I had interviewed and accepted a job offer out of state for role I specifically wanted and had been developing myself for. My new firm offered helped pay for relocation and my salary went from $18 to $35 an hour. The job is fantastic and with the money I saved I was able to buy a ""newer"" used car and get my own studio close to my job. My commute is now 15 minutes max. EDIT: WOW! I did not expect this to blow up as it has and I sure as hell did not expect all the positivity. I was expecting more people to get mad at me for doing something that errs on the illegal side. But thank you everyone! Please be advised I do not encourage this though. For anyone who was wondering I was living in Thousand Oaks and my job was in LA. Let's just leave it at that. For anybody here still in college, the reality is your bachelors alone is not enough. You're also going to need experience or you have to know someone. Internships, connections, clubs, even a high GPA (yes some places did check my grades and I got screwed because of that) does help. Hit up alumni or go to networking events and try to learn practical skills. It's a highly competitive world out there and the world doesn't owe you a thing. And yes I considered myself very lucky to work for a company with all those perks. And that was one of the reasons why I really thought I could move up here and took the job despite the commute. But instead I was basically a clerk and pretty much everyone outranked and made more than me and treated me as such. What was worse was most of the people there were my age, so the environment was really cliquey and toxic. And for those who think this is fake due to my account. Well obviously this isn't my main account. Like most people on reddit I have several accounts for different interests. I couldn't post this on my main account because some people know me. I used this one due to it being the most anonymous and because it's my favorite account name.",,https://old.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/dq0a6n/at_my_previous_job_i_slept_in_my_car_outside_the/

confessions,To people all around the world (self.confessions),"To people all around the world, We, Hongkongers just experienced a terrorist attack planned and executed by our Hong Kong Police Force. At about 10pm today, our police force rushed into our railway system in Prince Edward station, got in to the carriage and indifferently beat up all the people in it regardless they are protesters or simply passengers. They ignored the weapon guidelines and fired tear gas indoor in the carriage which is in fact lethal. Also, they beat up innocent people causing them seriously wounded. Some passengers kneeled before them asking them to stop but the response they got were beaten ever harder. Meanwhile, the police haven’t arrested the passengers after they got beaten up, showing that the only purpose of their brutality was to sort their anger to violence but not dispersing the crowd.

confessions,My little brother has tried to kill my little sister twice and I look forward to any excuse to never have to talk to him again. I hate him. He's 7 years old.

I've spent a lot of time around children and I've never met one to whine and complain and scream about anything and everything as much as he does. He's tried to kill my little sister (3yo) twice now. Once he held her head under the water in the kiddy pool until someone caught him. The second time he held a pillow on her face until my mom caught him because she heard a ruckus in the living room. My mom tried the ""he's seven he doesn't know better"" defense, but I would argue that because he's taken and finished swimming lessons he knows what it means to drown. He has manipulative tendencies that take too much text to get in to, but he's said things to me that hurt me in a way that I can't forgive whether he meant them or not. If we find dead animals under his bed or he gets caught with a dead body one day, I'm fully prepared to tell my entire family ""I told you so,"" and let them be mad at me because this kid is nuts and I want nothing to do with him.",,https://old.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/jp0um4/my_little_brother_has_tried_to_kill_my_little/

confessions,I now own my Parents House and plan to evict them (self.confessions),"Hi folks, I hope you're all doing well. And that you're getting a lot off your chests where needed. So this is a story all about how, my life got flipped, turned upside down, so I worked hard and bought my parents house. Now I will admit this right from the start, I'm not a good person, by doing what I am doing . TL:DR is at the bottom if you'd rather a summary of the whole crazy story I'll have to give a little bit of backstory to explain this whole thing, my parents married young, I wasn't planned, and when they were growing up, it was the standard thing that when you have a baby, you get your own place. It didn't matter if you rented or bought a place. So with my parents being young and with a baby on the way, they rented from this lovely fellow from Osaka, Japan, who we'll call Uncle Kiryu. Now Uncle Kiryu was a wealthy man, who made a lot of money from Oil and Property, but he started from nothing, so he knew that being young, you needed a helping hand to get people started. So he would rent out apartments and houses at lower than market rates for people who wanted a roof over their heads, he still made a profit and because he had so many properties, he has always had steady income, whether theres a recession, floods, war etc Now Uncle Kiryu was always generous to me and my family, helped where he could, we even had him over for birthdays and New Years. He once brought me to the dentist when I fell and broke a tooth at age 11, and he paid it without question. Overtime, as my parents got older, finished college, got better Jobs, he helped them moved from a one bedroom apartment with no garden, to a nice townhouse, to a 3 bedroom house right outside the City Centre in Dublin. All of which, he owned and rented out to them. However, if Kiryu has a fault, he always tries to see the best in people, even if their flaws are staring him in the face. The reason I'm telling you so much about Uncle Kiryu, is because he is very important in this story, and because I literally owe him my life. About 12 years after they had me, they unfortunately were in a car accident, and had numerous injuries. My dad cracked his ribs, tore a muscle in his back and dislocated both shoulders, my Mum broke her leg in 2 places and shattered her right foot. Thanks to these injuries, they sadly lost their jobs (this was back when you could get away with making people redundant for long term medical injuries). Thanks to the injuries and losing their jobs, they were stuck at home all day, and could do very little except take painkillers and watch tv. I spent a lot of time with family, babysitters or just hanging out with friends outside for at least a year while they recovered and went through rehab and surgeries. There is a part of long term injuries that isn't always brought up: Pain management. Between broken bones, torn muscles and not being able to work, Mum and Dad were in pain, and taking a lot of pills and injections just to function, and well......pain medication can be quite addictive and can change you as a person. This was only too clear to see as my parents changed from proud, hard working, loving people to addicts who cared about getting a fix. Once they recovered from their injuries, they couldn't get pain pills anymore, so they switched to heroin and alcohol. Once that started, the abuse soon followed. They teased me about everything: Making me feel bad about getting 92 on a test (why didnt you get the other 8 percent?) Stealing money I was making at a part time job I had as a waitress in a hotel. (Its in our house, so its our money) Complaining about having to pay for new bras/clothes when I outgrew them (which I unfortunately did a lot), culminating in me learning to sow/make my own bra extenders and repair tears in my clothes and school uniform. (To this day, I still have an emergency clothes fund as a just in case) Guilting me into slowly doing more and more housework, to the point my days literally consisted of 'Get up, make their breakfast, go to school, occasionally go to work, come home, do the housework, make dinner, do homework, shower, bed'. The moment that broke me was when I was 17, we had been fighting over something stupid, to this day, I still cant remember what, but I do remember what they said to me: Dad: You're just a lazy, good for nothing bitch, all you do is rip your clothes with your fat fucking tits and complain, even though we keep this roof over your head and food in the fridge. Mum: So shut up, you're worthless, you're just going to be a waitress all your life anyway. You're not worth a Fiver. This was followed by a slap from Dad and my Mum spitting on me. Have you ever heard the expression, you cant see the forest through the trees? Well that damn day lit a fire under me and I got ready to burn the forest down. What followed was me putting all my time into school and work. (This part will sound like I'm bragging, I dont mean to, I'll try to make it more factual and to the point) The next 5 years seemed to fly by in a month, I dont know how or why but I turned into a machine and made something of myself: I finished my Leaving Cert (the equivalent of SAT's for you lovely Yanks across the sea), and got into culinary college. Passed with flying colours (and a very sticky Croquembouche that fell on my teacher) and got a job as a prep chef in the hotel I was working at. Moved out of my parents house and into an apartment, thank you Uncle Kiryu! Busted my ass and got promoted to Commis Chef, then Line Chef, and after about 3 years, Sous Chef. I wasn't the best chef there, far from it, but until I made Sous Chef, I was paid hourly, so I worked every hour they would give, and that earned me a lot of respect, plus I would always clear the oil and water drains in the kitchens. Save up a lot of money for a rainy day All the while, my parents fell deeper into their addictions. We kept our distance mostly, we saw each other on birthdays, Christmas etc. Occasionally I'd get a call to borrow money for food (heres a tip, if someone asks for food money, offer to bring them shopping, if they're genuine, they'll jump at the chance, if not, they'll run). Whenever I visit, their house has fallen into disrepair. Broken windows, torn wallpaper, burn marks everywhere, mold in the ceiling etc, broken plumbing (seriously, I had to turn the water off to stop the 2nd floor from being destroyed). Uncle Kiryu notices but they wont let him in to fix the place up. The moment that made my attitude go from 'I'm going to make something of myself' to 'I will destroy you' was last Christmas. We went to a family get together, and it was the usual party: Big turkey, way too much mulled wine, tons of pressies, old song about Auld Lang Syne and everyone watching Mr's Browns Boys (Its a popular show with our family). My lovely aunt was telling anyone who would listen how I helped save her daughters wedding by catering the whole thing (I didn't, I just put her in contact with a friend of mine who specialises in wedding meals) and my Dad in his pill and mulled wine induced stupor decided to rant about my career. A Caterer? A fucking caterer? Oh no, I'm sorry, you're some big poncy chef! Why didn't you go into construction like me? Do something useful with your life, not some worthless career where all you do is peel potatoes all day. My Mum of course, decides to chime in and essentially mumbles some inordinate abuse, calling my work 'not a proper job, anyone can do it. A cow like you isn't worth a damn fiver'. Now this is where they touched a nerve, I will admit, I'm a woman who has an ego when it comes to my work. I'm not at the level of Michelin star chefs, but I'm damn good at what I do, I worked hard to get there and I know I'm worth something. Skipping forward a couple of weeks and I'm at my Uncle Kiryu's house for his New Years party (he always celebrates it in Mid January for some reason), and he's talking about work and how its a good time to sell some of his properties that are vacant, and it hits me: What if I buy my parents house? So Uncle Kiryu and I get talking and he realises that with the house in such a state of disrepair, it would cost a lot to repair, so he agrees to sell it to me at a cheaper price rather than having it fixed up first. I'm not proud of this, but I convinced (read: outright lied) him that I wanted to buy the place to ensure my parents would always have a roof over their heads. Well it took nearly 6 months (and this damnable Covid 19 crisis didn't help) but soon enough, I got the confirmation from my lawyer and estate agent that I now own my parents 3 bedroom house and I'm their new landlord. As part of the sale, I asked Uncle Kiryu to organise the transfer of rent payments to a new bank account that I setup, and I've had him work as my intermediary with them, so they havent had to meet their new landlord yet. I can't evict them yet (there is currently a freeze on evictions in my Country), but once the Covid 19 crisis is done, they'll have 3 months to get the hell out, then I can fix the damage they've done and move into my own home. Meanwhile, they're on benefits and can barely afford a damn meal, never mind somewhere to live. I'm watching the calendar, waiting for my day to visit and serve an eviction notice. I'm not the good girl or the hero of this story, but I'm worth more than a fiver. TL:DR Parents brand me as useless, light a fire under my ass and fall into addiction, I use the fire to burn down a forest, get a job and buy their house, which will leave them homeless by 2021. Updates: Sooooooooo this is what people mean by RIP my inbox!! Wow theres been a lot of feedback and advice on this, both in the comments and via PM, some constructive and positive, some honest and negative, and some cool offers for drinks. Thank you everyone for the advice, here is the answer to some of the questions I got: Will you tell your Uncle Kiryu the truth? Yes I will tell him the truth, we're meeting for lunch on Thursday, I'm cooking his favourite :) Arent you buying a heavily damaged/trashed house? I've visited enough to see what I'm dealing with. The damage is mostly superficial, the most expensive part will be replacing the carpets, broken shower and broken windows. It will take time to finish redecorating and fixing the place, but heres the thing, the house is mine, I'm not in a rush, I'm not selling it or trying to rent it out again, so I can take my time to get it right. Rome wasnt built in a day. Why are you doing this? Some of this is for revenge, but the main motivation is, that place was my home, I want to continue my life there and move on from that part of my history. Plus I'm getting a 3 bedroom house in Ireland, it will be mine, I will live there and have my home. Lastly, I can move on from the bad part of my life into a new, and hopefully better one. I think the apple doesnt fall far from the tree/you're full of hate and anger/you're cruel etc. You're right. I never claimed to be a hero or a good person in this story. I have a cruel streak, I look after myself first. Not to be crude, but after going through all the hell, fire and just pure shite life has thrown at me, I'm fighting back, and fighting dirty. Have you thought/tried to get your parents into rehab? Yes. I tried, their parents tried, their now ex friends tried, Uncle Kiryu tried. We all pushed so hard, but its just too much. I am just too burned out from everything to do that again. Why not just cut them out of your life? Thats what I am doing. I'm cutting them out of my life, once they're evicted, they're gone. The locks will be changed, I'll be getting new alarm systems. I have no intentions of speaking to them again. After some advice, I'm going to go no contact. So no more meeting at birthdays, Xmas, weddings. Insert Legal advice involving UK law here. Much obliged and thanks, you guys, however there are different laws in the Ireland compared to the UK. Wont your Uncle Kiryu just rent them out another place? I doubt it. He might, but considering the damage done to this house, and the strained relationship they have, it is unlikely. Plus his other properties are (most likely, I could be wrong) outside of their price range. Update with Kiryu: Finally got a chance to meet with Uncle Kiryu, I invited him to taste some of our new dishes in work and admitted to him why I REALLY wanted to buy the house. He nodded and said very simply: 'I know. I am not happy about this. But I know why you're doing this, Senshi (his nickname for me.) Once I convinced him that I wasnt planning on burning the house down (he was very concerned about it for some reason), he gave me some advice, and gave me the name of a management company, saying that he no longer wanted to be the intermediary. He asked if I realised they would have no home after this and that he cannot save them, I explained that I did. After that, he asked me to cook his favourite dish as 'Punishment' and made me promise to give him plenty of notice when the eviction proceedings so he could be miles away. Thank you to everyone who advised me to tell him. You were right.",MistressLezRoleplay,https://old.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/htl90f/i_now_own_my_parents_house_and_plan_to_evict_them/
confessions,I called Child Services on an anti-vaxx parents because they kept asking for “natural” remedies online for their severely sick child instead of taking their child to the hospital because they don’t believe in doctors or medicine (self.confessions),"I don’t feel bad at all because not vaccinating your child is something but not getting medical care for your severely sick child because you don’t believe in doctors or modern medicine is to me a form of abuse. Edited: The reason this is a confession is because the people I reported were once very close family friends so i may not regret it but I still feel bad because that’s just me and no one in my family knows it’s me Update: I called child services to ask for an update and they told me the case is closed and nothing else. I heard my family talking that his/her parents took him/her out from the hospital and that’s it. Basically, all I did is nothing and I didn’t help my god child at all.

confessions,My wife thinks I’m just being cute and romantic (self.confessions),"I have always called my wife by terms of endearment rather than her name; Sweetheart, Darling One, etc. After 23 years of marriage she is actually taken aback if I call her by name at this point, which almost never happens anyway. There’s a reason, and it’s not because it was an ex-girlfriend’s name or anything like that. It’s just... I hate it. I think it’s an ugly name. It grates on me, rubs me entirely the wrong way, and I can’t stand using it to identify someone I’m very much in love with. (I won’t say what it actually is because she might read this and I’d rather she didn’t find out, so let’s just say it’s Gretchen, which is a name I hate in the same way.) Not as juicy a confession as some on here, but that’s mine. Edit: I’m really surprised at how many people assume she must be “Karen.” I did say we’d been married for 23 years. Karen was just another name only a few years ago. Edit 2: Okay, what the hell. It’s Rachel.

confessions,My younger brother died a couple years ago. His cat still mourns him. (self.confessions),"Our household had two cats at the time. One cat was the family cat, but the other cat, Edward, obviously loved my brother more than anyone. They’d always cuddle together on the sofa and Ed would be always be at his side. Ed loved me too, but it was obvious it wasn’t the same. When my brother died, Edward was a wreck as was the rest of the family. He would wait outside my brother’s door, crying for him. I’d wake up in the middle of the night, after crying myself, only to find Edward sitting in my brother’s empty bedroom looking downward. He’d seem to endlessly cry for my brother. And it was apparent that he knew what had happened, he seemed to know my brother had died. He knew he wasn’t coming back. The silver lining though, is that Edward still loves my brother, even several years later. He sits right beside my brother’s altar, resting his head on the box of his ashes. Sometimes, I’ll see him staring at photos of my brother. His eyes will be incredibly focused on the photos and he’ll rest a paw on them. He doesn’t do this to any other photos. I have a friend who is about the same height and weight as my brother and shares some traits. When he would come visit, Edward knew it wasn’t him, but that kind of person is the type of he loves. Edward instantly snuggles up to him. He loves being around tall adolescent guys, I think they remind him of my brother. When I’m with Ed, I remind him how much I love him and I hold onto him for hours. He’s a simple cat, a little dumb, he drools, but he’s the most emotionally intelligent animal I’ve ever seen. I love him endlessly. He’s helped me a lot. He so plainly loves and misses my brother. He’s doing a lot better and no longer crying every night for my brother, he’s enjoying life but leaving time to remember his favorite guy. It pushes me forward. Because if a cat can love and properly, healthily mourn, then so can I. Edit: I will post a photo of Edward when I get home today. Here is the photo of him: https://imgur.com/a/vYLMuL7[Edward the cat](https://imgur.com/a/vYLMuL7)",Classic-Dog8399,https://old.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/rsco8r/my_younger_brother_died_a_couple_years_ago_his/
confessions,"Pretty sure my ex boyfriend had sex, and maybe still is having sex, with his mother (self.confessions)","I used to have this friend. We'll call him Brian. He and I ""dated"" when we were in 7th and 8th grades. It wasn't a serious relationship, we were way too young for that, but we ""dated"". We kind of drifted apart after middle school. One week, during senior year of high school, he just sort of disappeared. Gone without a trace. Nobody seemed to know what happened, he just dropped off the face of the earth. His best friend had no idea and couldn't get in touch with him. He even jilted his would-be prom date. As you can imagine there were lots of rumors, everything from him dying to him going to jail, etc. But the big rumor that got passed around the most was that his dad caught he and his mom en flagrante. I thought it was just a dumb rumor, because it's obvious to see why that sort of rumor would be popular even if it isn't true. Plus I knew Brian and his mom and it just didn't seem likely. They were very normal, upper middle class, not like toothless rednecks or anything. Oh, yeah, and who does that? Going to jail for murder seemed wayyy more likely than that. Anyway, after college I moved to a really tiny city in a rural area halfway across the country, literally thousands of miles from where I grew up, because I fucking love mountains and also nobody can afford to live where I grew up anymore. This weekend I went to a Target in a different town that I don't usually go to. Guess who I saw there? Yep. And they were acting... you know. Familiar. They didn't kiss or anything, but it was unmistakable. Wayyyy too much touching, hand-holding, that sort of thing. I stalked them around the store a bit, just because I was so intensely curious, and even out into the parking lot to get a look at them without masks on. It was definitely them. Thankfully they didn't notice me (I look a lot different now, which helps, plus I was wearing a mask and sunglasses). Really weird! Just like... I'm in shock. I don't know, I've been dying to tell someone but I'm not close to many people from high school anymore. The only friend I still talk to really is really dramatic and I know she can't keep a secret, and even though I would sooner die than have sex with my mom or dad I don't necessarily want to ruin Brian's life or whatever (or ruin it any more than it already has been). I was thinking about telling my roommate, but tbh I don't like her that much. So... I'm telling you all this piece of juicy gossip instead. I know it means way less to you than it does to me, but there it is. Anyway... the world is a fucked up place. Edited for typos EDIT: You all found this way more interesting than I expected. To respond to some common comments: No, he's not adopted that I know of. I doubt he secretly is based on how they look, but who knows. Yes, it's very gross. To the people saying I don't have any hard proof: you're right! But I'm not just basing this off of them holding hands. They were acting like a couple in ways that are hard to describe but you know when you see it. Maybe some people act this way with their parents, I definitely don't, but they didn't act that way together when I knew them. Add that to the old rumor and I'm pretty convinced. Yes, she probably groomed and raped him, though like I said I never saw any evidence of anything weird when we were dating. Also he had other girlfriends in high school. If I could call the cops and have him sent to psychotherapy I would, but I googled around and it looks like he would just go to jail which I don't think would help anyone. Plus I don't know what I would tell them. See above. I googled the ""broken arms"" thing and I really wish I hadn't.",WeirdExStory,https://old.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/ion071/pretty_sure_my_ex_boyfriend_had_sex_and_maybe/
confessions,"My boyfriend thinks he's feeding the neighborhood stray cats. Today I learned that he's actually feeding possums, and I'll never tell him. (self.confessions)","The lockdown was really getting to him. Recently, we noticed that there's a family of stray cats that live near us. He started putting food out for them every single night. Occasionally he'll peek out the window to see if they're out there. He's never seen them eat the food, but the bowl is always empty. He worries about whether they're eating enough, and if they know how to cross the street safely. It's very cute. Today, I was on my way home and when I walked over to check the food, I saw an enormous possum just devouring. He's had such a sense of purpose taking care of the cats, and I don't want to ruin it, so you guys are the only people I'm going to tell. Edit: update for anyone creeping my profile and reading this way later: He found out about the possum(s). There are probably two or three of them, and we found out they actually live in the same little area with the cats. The cats have gotten a lot more friendly, but the possums remain skittish. Every time he sees a possum, he excitedly sends me a text and picture.

confessions,I haven't told my partner that I'm dying because I don't know how. She's excited to plan a life around mine and it's breaking my heart. (self.confessions),"Throwaway account, but there it is. The title basically sets the entire premise of this, but I was recently brought up to speed on my condition and what the survival rate looks like for someone in my position (stage IV cancer, spread throughout). It's next to 0, and I'm a realist so my days are numbered to just a handful of years at most in some of the best case scenarios. I've been in a relationship with a woman who's been through a tremendous amount of painful losses and setbacks recently in her life. She's made it clear that I've gotten her through some very rough patches and that imagining a life with me has made it easier for her to move past those events and consider a future for herself. I don't have many regrets in life and I consider myself very privileged to have seen the things I've seen, visited the places I've been, and loved the people I've loved. It sounds strange, but I'm kinda ready. The only thing that is breaking my heart is that I have no idea how to break this to the person who has attached her orbit to a dying star unknowingly. EDIT: I see there are a few questions about the diagnosis. I know this is the internet and folks are out to poke holes in stuff, but in the interest of spreading awareness for anyone who has experienced or has seen these symptoms, I'll elaborate as much as I can without getting too much into personal details. This is the result of a regional recurrent melanoma that spread beyond the origin area. The original melanoma displayed irregular borders, dark pigmented regions contrasting with lighter regions, and was removed with clear margins and follow up PET scans showed no traces of metastasis outside of the local region. Bullet dodged. I went on attending regularly scheduled screenings with dermatologists for over a decade, up until I hit a rough patch in my life and stopped. Once you are diagnosed with a melanoma, you must (MUST MUST MUST) adhere to a 6 month schedule of skin screenings to make sure there is no recurrence or separate growths occurring. A melanoma can spread incredibly fast compared to other cancers, so it must be caught very quickly (within 6 months). Someone proven to be susceptible to melanoma should create a regimen for getting these screenings scheduled and adhere to them. Insurance won't always cover them (which is insane, but that's another thread), but the cost out of pocket without insurance should be around $250-300 USD. Budget for that. It sucks, but that's what you have to do. If you don't have the means to pay for the screenings, there are options such as the SpotMe program by the AAD that offer free skin screenings and consult. I fell into a period in my life where I lapsed in these screenings. For just a tad over 3 years, I let them go by because I was alone, depressed, and didn't see the point. By the time I met someone who made me want to turn things around and get myself into shape and take care of myself, it was already back and had a head start. So PLEASE GET YOURSELF SCREENED. And if you've ever been diagnosed with a melanoma or even a benign form of cancer, GET YOURSELF ON A SCREENING SCHEDULE AND PLEASE STICK TO IT.",ShortTim3r,https://old.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/bjnw9a/i_havent_told_my_partner_that_im_dying_because_i/

confessions,I lie to my son. (self.confessions),"I have a 5 year old son, he's the light of my life, and means the world to me. I divorced from his mother 2 years ago, and have a little less than 50% custody; it kills me every day I don't have him, but I make do. I do my best to always ""do what's right"" when raising him. But lately, I've been lying to my son, regularly and often. Pretty much every day I have him. You see, recently he has taken a shining to Pokemon. We watch the old ones on Netflix, he has a Cubone pokeball made out of legos I bought him, and loves Pikachu. I want to get him an old Nintendo 2ds or, ideally, a switch, but can't afford one right now; so I downloaded Pokemon Go. He. Loves. It. I set him up with an account on my phone, and when he got sad about not having any friends, I made an account on my work phone so we can trade gifts. He has asked me to catch Pokemon he doesn't have when I'm at work or when he's at his Mom's house. I did for the first couple days. But seeing his face light up when he catches a new one made me stop. I tell him I look for new ones but don't find any, when in reality I just catch at least one he already has once a day to keep his streak going. I can't stand to miss seeing his reaction when he gets a new one he hasn't seen yet. It absolutely makes my day. I also sometimes catch multiple ones he already has just so he can get more candies and level his Pokemon up.. He thinks they just give him more because he's a good trainer. I do not dispute this, and say that they must know how much he cares about his Pokemon and how he takes good care of them. I also told him that even though we don't have a Pikachu, I'll catch one if I ever see one. But I lied. I have one on my account, and purposefully didn't get it on his. You should see the way he lights up at catching a weedle, or a swablu, or a nosepass, or some other minor one... I don't want to miss what his reaction will be when we finally get his Pikachu. I want to have him there to celebrate instead of just catch him one. I can't wait until we get that little yellow guy. So I lie, every day, to my son.

And the day after I tell her, I’m leaving on a week long trip w my (non-muslim) grandma. my parents already know that i don’t believe in islam anymore, but i still lead an islamic lifestyle per their request. So I feel like telling them this will be the final blow for them. I feel really bad because I know this will tear my mom apart, and when I graduated she expressed how proud she was. I don’t want to disappoint her 😞 But i want to do this for myself, just feeling nervous about it though.

confessions,"My parents and I caused her death, I hate them and myself for it (self.confessions)","I honestly don't know, but I feel like I want to share this today. I've been starting at a bottle of cheap whiskey for far too long now. Anyway, this all happened almost 6 years ago and obviously the account is a throwaway. I use reddit normally and I love browsing this sub so I'm confident there can be some understanding here, or so I hope. So let's rewind the clock back 6 years to a time when my sister and I were 16. Wish I could huh. Anyway. My sister Jane was the sweetest person I've ever met. Well I didn't think that higly of her at the time. Besides being sweet and nice to almost everyone she was a perfect tomboy - you know, short hair, boy clothes, interested more in cars than dolls if you get my gist. This has all happened over a longer period of time. She started with the more boy-ish look when she was 13, my parents thought it was a phase and told her to dress normally. After many, many fights they gave up and allowed her to dress that way. Those were some terrible few weeks, many slaps, beatings and a lot of yelling from my dad and constant crying from my mom. Now I know the reason was they didn't want their daughter to be seen as one of those freaks. My parents are not religious, at least not more than your average family. They never forced their beliefs onto us, I got into the atheism craze when I was in my early teens and they didn't care for it, just told me not to tell people around (a lot of our family is religious). My dad was a police officer, pretty high ranking as well. He loved his job and was quite liberal in my opinions, extremely inclusive of other races and whatnot. He was also really lax with the rules. He often showed us his gun and on my grandad's estate/farm he told us to shoot with a similar gun while making sure we understand proper gun handling, care for the weapon, how to reload, not to put a finger on the trigger and to never ever aim at anyone. The issues of gay and trans people came up very rarely but I remember someone on TV speaking about it, or maybe it was a movie I can't recall, but both of my parents were disgusted just by the thought. This was when I was 11 or 12. I asked about it, like the curious little shit I was, and my parents explained to both myself and my sister about what a gay is and transgender person is and so on. They outright said that those people are sick and should be in a hospital, same like pedophiles (we already had the talk about not going to people's cars etc...) or murderes. My sister didn't really react but I did jump on that. With my friends we made these dumb stories and included a lot of gay and trans characters getting killed or being locked somewhere in prison. My parents praised me for being creative after hearing a pretty damn long story for a 12 year old. Anyway, year later my sister started with the tomboy stuff and I didn't think of it much but fast forward 2 years, we're both newly fifteen and it clicks in my brain - why my parents were so opposed to it and what my sister really was. She was transgender! I felt mad at myself for even thinking my own sister could something so vile. I asked her several times and every single time she told me to screw off or just refuted it. Few months passed and our relationship turned sour. We barely talked. I couldn't look at her and whenever I started talking Jane would make every effort to leave the room as soon as possible. Then came a night, I was staying up late playing World of Warcraft after my friends logged off. I went to grab a drink from the kitchen. To go down the stairs I always passed her room. I heard a sound. It was so strange like a cry of a weird creature. Shitting my pants I opened the door. I saw her, crying on the floor. The sound was her trying to be quiet. For that short moment everything was gone. I ran to her asking what's happened, helping her up, sitting her down on her bed and giving her a hug. It was the first moment we shared after such a long time. She told me the truth. She was afraid, hurt and trans. I don't think I've ever been more conflicted than in that moment. I hated that she was trans I hated all trans people for infecting her with the virus with the illness. But she was my sister, someone I shared so much who was there for me when I was crying. I couldn't let go and so I just held her and stayed there through the night. Non of her words reached me. She fell asleep that morning and because it was Saturday I put a blanket over her and let her sleep. She slept until 2pm when my mom woke her up with a yell. She looked at me, with red eyes, mouthing 'Thank you'. I remember that clear as day. After lunch I told her I want to talk and that we did. I suggested we tell our parents, that she is trans, and they can get treatment for her and she can be cured. That was the moment it all began to go downhill, my mom overheard. ARE YOU TRANS? she screamed and called for dad. Jane kept silent so they turned to me asking if she admitted to it. I nodded. My father beat her behind with a belt, leaving a few cuts. They kept screaming, Jane kept crying and I just stood there. Our sixteenth birthday came. Over the few months I did warm up to trans people and read a lot online, asked people and used a few forums and message boards to talk to trans people. My parents didn't want to hear a word of it thought. Jane and I were born on the 14th of February, Valentine Twins haha. I liked the date for two reasons, it was like the whole world was celebrating my birthday. I got a cake and a ton of gits and just like every year I bought something small for Jane. This year I was conflicted but I decided to buy one anyway. It was this adorable huge teddy bears. Not your standard Valentine's one, but a proper (and expensive) teddy. And just live every year our parents had work the day after. I couldn't stomach it and give Jane the gift on the 14th as I planned, even my parents didn't celebrate her birthday - just mine. I thought what a great idea to give it to her on the 15th when parents aren't there. I felt really bad for her and so I wrote a letter. Tried my best at proper cursive it was a mumbling bs of how I still love her and parents don't understand. I ended it with, I'm glad to have you as my brother. I remember writing those words, feeling kinda weird but happy at the same time. After they left I opened the door but (s)he wasn't there. I put down the bear and put the letter on his huge fluffy head. I left the room and went to play World of Warcraft again, waiting for him to find it. I did hear the door to his room open and close. I think it was almost an hour before a sound went through my headphones. A sound so fucking loud my ears were ringing. It took me a couple of seconds to put one and one together to realise it was a gunshot. There it was that thought of what happened. I didn't want it to be true. I wanted to run but at the same time I wanted to avoid knowing but what if...so many fucking what ifs, if I didn't play that fucking stupid game and just waited for her god damnit. I opened the door and he lied there. In a pool of his own blood hugging that stupid teddy bear. That momnet was the longest moment ever. I feel down just fell I didn't even try to hold myself up. Ended up with a broken finger. After coming back to my senses I called an ambulance. It was too late. It was my dad's gun, that's why he wasn't in his room he was getting into his safe to get hold of it. After few days I found an envelope with my name on it. There was five 60 day cards for World of Warcraft.For the best brother, a note read inside. It was his gift for me. It took my weeks to redeem them but after I did I made a character, named him a weird variation of Jay (as he went by to friends) and our last name. Played him for a long time before quitting. I wanted to take my own life, to join her somewhere...today all those stupid hearts and celebrations are just a reminder of this. I'm sorry for rambling. I'm sorry for everything.

confessions,My 10yo son made me cry tonight (self.confessions),"Not really tucking him in, but more of a few minutes of quiet father-son time. After he was done with his shower, he told me he didn't want me to say goodnight in his room anymore. I asked him why and he said ""dad I'm a 10yo kid."" My first response was going to be ""so?"" But instead I said ""okay."" I was fine with his not wanting to hold hands or walk besides me or meeting him outside his class, but this actually broke my heart. I love this kid so much. I won't lie. I went to bed and cried like bitch. Update: Thanks for your comments. I have been busy and am shocked this got so many upvotes.

confessions,War is Darkness (self.confessions),"I'm from Iran. I used to come to reddit to feel better and have a laugh or two. After the recent events everything has changed and everybody is making memes about WWIII, and it makes me sad to see all of these memes and funny photos of war in Iran. I know it's fun but on the other hand people seem to forget that with war comes darkness. So many people are gonna die and sadness will consume my country and the US (it's already happening imo). I'm not taking my government side or the US. All I'm saying is that war is not the answer. I wish it didn't happen. Iranian are friendly people. the government does not represent it's own people. I strongly hope the war doesn't happen and the phase of WWIII memes goes away and we go back to baby yoda memes. Edit: Thanks for all the warm and kind word from all over the planet.

confessions,I accidentally made my cat gay and he thinks I’m his lover (self.confessions),"So my cat, Franki, recently came down with a pretty severe stomach virus. The vet gave me some anti biotic drops to put in his food but when I’d do that Franki wouldn’t touch it. So, the vet suggested using a small dropper tube to insert the medicine directly into his anus. The first time was absolute hell, my cat fought me the whole time but once the tube was in and the medicine pushed out he seemed to calm quite a bit. Well the next day he was acting strange, he has always been an independent cat, rarely coming around, never wanting to be held, but as I sat on the couch he started walking back and forth meowing and rubbing my leg. He then went and jumped up on the table where we’d done the application the night before and meowed louder and louder until I decided I guess we will go ahead and do the medicine treatment. This time he didn’t fight me though, and when I inserted the tube he closed his eyes, stretched his neck, and let out a noise that can only be described as a moan of pure ecstasy. Maybe the medicine made him feel better, I supposed. That night he slept on my bed curled up right next to me, which he had never done before. For the next week he’d do the same thing every day, meow on the table until he got his ‘fix’... But then the medicine ran out. Even though I had no medicine he’d still cry and beg for it, I thought maybe if I insert it without medicine he will realize it doesn’t make him feel better anymore and forget about it. Well that was 2 weeks ago and he is only getting worse. He walks around me all day with his tail up presenting his rectum and trying to entice me. He is demanding insertions more and more often. Yesterday I caught him looking longingly at the turkey baster... When I sit he jumps in my lap purring and rubbing me affectionately. It was then in horror I realized my cat thinks I’m his gay lover, and that I’ve been sexually pleasing him for weeks now. Needless to say the sexual tension between us is palpable. How do I let my cat know that I’m not gay, but still like him as a friend?",nickrashell,https://old.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/9sluqc/i_accidentally_made_my_cat_gay_and_he_thinks_im/
confessions,I made a huge mistake with my son in law and can’t say anything. (self.confessions),"This has been bothering me for awhile, and I just need to say it I think. I know this was very poor judgment and I have felt completely awful since this happened. I am divorced from my husband of 36 years. Our divorce was finalized in November of 2018. He immediately had a girlfriend about 15 years younger than me. After the divorce I got very depressed and had zero self confidence. I used it as motivation and got in shape. I lost 20 pounds and decided to get breast implants. I got them last June. After I got them I basically hit from the world for about a month until I was confident enough to go out again and had recovered. My daughter and son in law have a pool in the backyard. Since it was summer I was at the pool some with them and grandkids. In late July my son in law made a comment about my boobs. I was totally mortified even though I knew it was obvious to them. I’ve been swimming with them for years. No real way to hide my boobs. Later that night he sent me a text apologizing for saying anything and said he was happy for me. I texted back and eventually sent him a selfie topless. He was very supportive and told me I looked amazing etc. I was at a very low place and had been drinking. I asked him if he wanted to come over and he did. We ended up having sex. I had not had sex in about 3 years and I think just the attention and being told I’m beautiful made me do It. I’ve sent him pictures a couple times since when he’s asked but have not done anything since. We’ve talked about it since and both agree it was a bad idea. We both swore we won’t ever tell my daughter. I have not told anyone about this. I feel so guilty and can’t stand I’m hiding something this big from my daughter. But I can’t bring myself to tell her.

confessions,My brother sexually abused me and my mother doesn't care (self.confessions),"This is a new account. I'm on my phone. Pardon my formatting. Might edit it later since I'm practically sobbing rn. I was 8 years old and he was 13. By that time, he'd already gotten sex ed classes at his school. He came to me and for several months showed me pornographic material. I couldn't escape because my parents would make me stay at home with him whenever they went out. It ended up happening because I was a little bitch and was more terrified of sleeping alone in the dark than my brother sexually abusing me while convincing me it was just a little game. I didn't understand at the time. I didnt even have a door in my room, so he'd often ""accidentally"" barge in while I was changing. I was 8 years old. He fucking groomed me into being okay wiyh him seeing me naked while at the same time saying I was acting ""obscenely"" for laying on the couch. I didn't even know what obscene meant. It was only once our parents caught us that I realised he'd used me for his sick fantasies. For me it was this little ""secret"" my brother told me to keep. I didn't realise the implication and that he'd abused my trust in my only sibling to have sex with me, a fucking CHILD. Even after being caught he'd still touch himself in front of me (I don't even understand how my parents could leave me alone with him after what had happened). By the time I turned 12 I'd have recurring nightmares about it but convinced myself that they were fantasies (I had repressed my memories) and that I was disgusting for thinking my big brother could have done that to me. I got into the habit of locking my door everynight once I finally got one and I didn't understand why. I slept with a lamp in my room, even more terrified of the dark than when I was a kid. It was like my mind decided to entirely wipe every memory out of my mind, my own mind was telling me I was disgusting for having nightmares about my brother touching me. But everyday I would wake up and act as if everything was normal. None of my parents ever brought it up. We became the perfect little family once again. At 18 I had a mental breakdown after realising I had almost no memories of my childhood save for my horrible nightmares. I confessed everything to my mom, having completely forgotten if I'd even told her or if she knew since nobody spoke about it. She told me she didn't remember and that it must have been experimentation. Just siblings playing wiyh each other. She didn't believe me. She had to ask my brother for confirmation. And of course he downplayed it. He played the victim, saying he didn't want it to damage my family once again and that he hadn't done much anyway. According to him it only happened once. Hahaha I distinctively remember everything and it hadn't been once. Since then I've been diagnosed with OCD, Anxiety and depression. I've been getting help and have cut all communication with my brother. He still tries to contact me and follow my socials. It gave me acid reflux (first time of my fucking life) from the amount of stress. My mom still tries occasionally to make me talk to him, telling me he's very sad and lonely and misses me. Maybe he should have thought about it before sexually abusing and raping me. It makes me sick that nobody else in my family knows about it. He still hangs around my younger half sister and cousin. And they don't even know. I can't even get justice because it happened so long ago. There's nothing I can do but try and not let it ruin my life. I'm 20 now. I have almost no childhood memories except from my nightmares. I'm depressed and have tried to kill myself once. And I'm terrified of getting into a relationship and having them discover this disgusting secret. Meanwhile he lives in another country with his beautiful malaysian girlfriend. So yeah. Life ain't fair. Thanks for allowing me to share my deepest darkest secret with you. God speed. Edit: Thank you so much for your kind words. I was in a dark place when I wrote this post, and still am since I don't have my meds. But reading your comments made me feel less alone. I just want to tell you thank you from the bottom of my heart for taking the time to read all this. It felt liberating and good to be supported..

confessions,He Doesn’t Need to Know. (self.confessions),"So, I work in a kitchen and am fortunate enough to work with many of my friends. My friend and manager, we’ll call him B, has been having really severe anxiety attacks lately and he’s been struggling a lot. For the past two weeks, I’ve been secretly stashing weed in his apron pockets, “accidentally” double-ordering Door Dash meals from his favorite places, scheduling Alexa to greet him with a “Good morning. Here’s today’s weather” and shuffle his favorite band every morning, and coming in early to get the workday started so he has less on his plate. His face lights up every time he finds that “random” weed or I yell to the back “You hungry? I’ve got extra!” and you can feel him breathe a sigh of relief when he sees half the stuff for the day has been started without him needing to do anything. He seems more relaxed and the anxiety seems to be less frequent. He’s just a nice dude and deserves for life to cut him a break and if the Universe doesn’t wanna do it, then I guess I will! EDIT: wow this totally took off! Thank you everyone! Sorry if you don’t consider this a “confession”, it felt like a confession to me because nobody knows I’m doing it? I guess… Except for all of you have seen this post now LOL. Thanks for all the love!! And I hope all of you find someone in your life, friend, family or SO who goes out of their way to make your day easier. Edit 2: Sooo some of you are upset this isn’t like a terrible thing but it was really nice to admit to what I was doing from an anonymous account. Promise I’ll post again if I do something bad!

confessions,I’ve been pretending to be dumb at work since I got hired. (self.confessions),"For context: I used to manage a cafe for years. There were people we would hire and they would be good at their job, but I wouldn’t rely on them for major things. When I quit there I thought “why can’t I just be a little dumber and work with less integrity.” And so I did exactly that. I’ve been slightly late almost every day, I keep “forgetting” things that are happening in the week. I ask how to do the same simple things over and over. Nobody asks me to do any extra stuff, and I believe that’s because they think I am dumb. It’s been fantastic. I love it. At the cafe I used to work, I always got “we’re so happy to have you on our team! You’re a great asset!” And never got a bonus or a substantial raise.

confessions,My 12 yo son still thinks I’m better at him at baseball. (self.confessions),"My 12 year old son that plays rep ball at a competitive level still thinks I’m better at ball than he his. He throws upwards of 60mph fastballs and hits like there’s no tomorrow. I have coached him most of his ball career so far and he’s seen some brilliant but brief flashes of my former young self such as me being able to beat all his buddies down the line to first. They actually take turns challenging me. This year I can still beat them, but I doubt I can keep this up. The last father and son game where the dads are against the sons, I mustered enough strength to turn a double into a triple hustling around the bags. I made it into 3rd on a very close sliding play. Everyone was impressed except my wife because she knew I was going to complain about the body pains the next day. That further cemented the fact my boy thinks I’m holding back my skills. I want to tell him I cant keep up anymore but I just want to hang on to this feeling a little longer, where he thinks I’m his hero. He has surpassed me in many ways and I am super proud. This is my confession. Edit: Wow, ok didn’t think my late night confession turned into this. Thank you for all the comments and feedback. Some of you have great stories of your own.

confessions,I was an aspiring youtuber and content creator who just deleted 11 years of work. (self.confessions),"My channel slowly died after the adpocalypse but besides the point its just really hard to be successful the way I want to be. I lost my youth trying to be successful and it went down to nobody watching my videos anymore. I had less than 2000 followers and subscribers. I tried and tried for 11 years, creating content nearly every day. I made cool game videos and mods that people liked enough to repackage and sell on their own. I came to the conclusion that its all over. I deleted over 3000 videos that went with my channel. I deleted my alt channels associated with that name. I deleted my twitter, facebook page, profile, discord. Everything except for the email address I use for work. I feel a sense of urgency this year to change my life and stop wasting my time. I wasted my time doing something I enjoyed that just happened to be done by more popular people who get the spotlight. Social media was part of the problem. The feeling that you need followers to enjoy your life. If nobody sees what you are doing then it doesn't exist right? That's a fake feeling that I needed to get rid of. I even deleted the reddit account under that name which had over 200k karma and a bunch of rewards. I'm done with trying to be a popular figure on social media.

confessions,I’m losing my girl tomorrow. (self.confessions),"I don’t really have a lot to say here. I don’t know where else to put this. I just have to say this to someone, even though no one will probably ever see this. My girl is leaving the world tomorrow. She was so small when i first held her. I was 5 and I held her in the palm of my hand. I never knew that teacup chihuahuas were so small. 15 years later, she’s struggling. Her hips are wobbly, her eyesight left, her hearing got bad, she doesn’t eat much, she doesn’t want water, and more recently, she’s showing sever signs of jaundice. Liver damage. After vet review, if she doesn’t pass in her sleep tonight, I have to take her to get euthanized tomorrow. I can’t say I wasn’t expecting it. I can’t say it’s not the right thing to do. But what I can say is that those 15 years were the best times of my life. I hope you know how much I love you little girl. Thank you for being my best friend. Rest In peace Roxy. EDIT: She is now in heaven with her friends and is eating all of the chicken nuggets in the world. Thank you so much for all of your kind words. It honestly helped. I never expected this get so much attention, but I am so grateful for every single one of you who wrote something. Thank you for the bottom of my heart.",prznmike,https://old.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/aeebxj/im_losing_my_girl_tomorrow/
confessions,"I cried for ten minutes in the bathroom of a karaoke. I thought nobody could hear me, I was wrong (self.confessions)","First night in Tokyo with the bf. Both good drinkers, experts on holiday. Late dinner at kaiseki place, we become friends with the chef, sous chef and waiter so we decide to go and do karaoke together. I am super shy and a notorious bad singer so when I hear my voice amplified I almost throw the mic away. Bf encourages me to sing all night choosing the songs he knows I know by heart (such a sweetheart) and handing me the microphone. I always start the song and than give away the microphone embarrassed. I feel like I'm ruining what could be an amazing night, everyone else is happy and enjoying themselves. After a while I can't take it anymore, so I head to the bathroom and start crying, looking at myself in the mirror and thinking what a complete failure I am, apparently also at karaoke now. I cry a lot, not bothering or trying to keep it down since the karaoke rooms are soundproofed and well, my logic isn't really in mint conditions. I exit the bathroom and see that the chef has been there all this time. He writes something on his phone and then hands it to me, his google translator says ""everything is going to be ok"".",the_soup_whisperer,https://old.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/dqe6ty/i_cried_for_ten_minutes_in_the_bathroom_of_a/
confessions,My son was vaccine injured and I’m sick of being lumped together with antivaxxers (self.confessions),"Disclaimer: his vaccine injury has been confirmed and diagnosed and was 100% legit. I’m not an antivaxxer. I’m sick of having to say that when I talk about his injury. Throwaway account because this gets personal. My son was about 2 and a half months old when he was vaccine injured. He was born with an extremely rare autoimmune disorder that was not diagnosed at birth. Of course we assumed he was a healthy kid, despite 2 previous infections, a bacterial infection and a viral infection, we went to get his 2 months shots. I decided I wanted to have a delayed schedule and not do all of his vaccines at once, because I was a new mom and was a little scared especially because of his previous infections. That fear saved his life. Before we even left the clinic, I noticed a weird spot on the soft part of his head but I dismissed it because it looked like a drop of pop and I was drinking a Pepsi so I just figured it might have dribbled off the can and onto his head. By the end of that night his entire head was covered in what I can only describe as green “pus” that was coming from his soft spot and when I gave him a bath he was screaming in pain every time I touched his tender head. I took him to the emergency room because he was vaccinated on a Friday so his pediatricians office was closed until Monday morning and as soon as I said “I think he might have a vaccine injury” it’s like a flip was switched and they all looked at me like I was wearing a tin foil hat and assumed I was an antivaxxer. If I was an antivaxxer he wouldn’t have been vaccinated. They sent me home with no tests and no answers. The next day it was getting worse. The green “pus” had dried and was peeling off his head and some of that stuff was still coming out of the soft spot on his head. He was actively losing hair and I could also tell he was having trouble breathing. I went again to the emergency room and they may as well have laughed in my face. They told me it was cradle cap and sent me home again without doing any tests and without any treatments. This was now Sunday night and the soft spot on his head was actually bleeding and he was definitely having a hard time breathing. He had now lost nearly all of his full head of beautiful hair, and by now his entire body was completely covered in a bright red rash and he was in so much pain. I was terrified. I took him for the third time to the er and I remember the doctor looking at me like I was an idiot and saying in the rudest voice “why are you here again?” I remember feeling so stupid. They gave me a prescription for cradle cap shampoo. I was bawling my eyes out and I remember asking “can you at least bandage his head?” Because the soft spot on his head was now a giant scab. Again, he might as well have laughed in my face. He said “there’s nothing we can do.” It was clearly not cradle cap and I knew something was very wrong. They also said his entire body covered in rash was simply a “diaper rash”. I was so terrified my baby wasn’t going to make it through that night. I stayed up all night with my sick, exhausted baby and as soon as his pediatricians office opened at 8am I called and said I need to make an appointment now because it’s an emergency. Luckily she had an opening for 830 and so we packed up and left right away. I walked in crying and told her everything that happened, she took her stethoscope and listened to his breathing and immediately called an ambulance. She said he was having a really hard time breathing and that he clearly had a severe infection. By this time, his entire body was red and there was no part of him that was clear from what looked like a horrible rash. I heard from the doctors at the children’s unit in the hospital that she had some words with the emergency room doctors because she was not happy with how we were brushed off. They did an X-ray on his chest and a blood test and told me he had pneumonia and MRSA and he was close to being septic. My baby was swelled up, he lost all his hair, we were both miserable, and it was a miracle he made it for those 3 days fighting for his life. I remember crying so hard when they said he had pneumonia. I’m crying right now just thinking about how I felt in that room when they told me how sick my baby was. This is so hard for me to talk about, but I need to get this off my chest. I feel like the reason they didn’t take me seriously at the emergency room is because antivaxxers think everything is a “vaccine injury” and so as soon as you say those words you’re automatically a crazy person and nobody is going to take you seriously. He was in the hospital for 2 weeks on IV antibiotics and they forced me to stop breastfeeding because they said he had dairy allergy. I knew it was bullshit and it was so heartbreaking that I had to stop breastfeeding my baby when he was just 3 months old and neither of us were ready for that. It was completely traumatizing for both of us. Another week went by and I heard some talk about “extremely low white cell counts” but didn’t know they were talking about my son, or what that meant. By this time we were also moved from the children’s unit to the PICU and he was receiving breathing treatments, IV antibiotics, a feeding tube, just hooked to all kinds of wires and I couldn’t even pick my baby up to comfort him. I couldn’t lay in the bed with him either, I remember leaning down and kind of trying to hug him and crying with him because I wanted nothing more than to just pick up my baby and comfort him. It was the most heartbreaking thing I’ve ever been through. It hurts so bad to even think about how scared and confused he must have been. All I could do everyday was just cry and pray to god please don’t take my baby from me. I was told we were going to be cleared to go home very soon but they were still running some tests. It seemed like they did a lot of extensive testing before the doctor came in with a grave look on his face and informed me my son was diagnosed with X linked SCID meaning he was born with nearly no immune system. This was not a moment of clarity for me and just raised so many more questions. I was then told we had to be transferred to a different hospital so he could receive treatment for his disorder because without a bone marrow transplant it is a terminal illness meaning he would die without it. So, I was a 19 year old new mother, and I had to leave everything I knew behind and move to this hospital 4 hours away because my son had a life threatening illness. He had to be put on isolation and could not have any contact with the outside world because any germs on him could cause an infection that his body naturally could not fight off. We stayed there for 2 months, at this point I had lost everything. My apartment, my job, my car, everything in my apartment, everything I had to my name, it was all gone. All I had was my son and the clothes I packed for us and I didn’t even care that I lost everything as long as I didn’t lose him I would be okay. I understood at this point that it was a miracle he had even made it out from all of this alive, he had 3 infections and a vaccine injury, I was learning more about his disorder and was starting to understand the severity of what my son was going through. a lot of babies that are born with this illness have died from pneumonia and infections and it’s especially dangerous to go undiagnosed like he did. We were told there was no bone marrow match so he could not have a transplant, but he needed treatment as soon as possible. Time was ticking, like I said it’s a terminal illness and if he did not receive treatment before 2 years old his body would succumb to his disorder and he would not make it. I was given the option of either waiting for a match which was not guaranteed, or go to a different state even further from my home so he could be put on a clinical trial and receive a new form of gene therapy. They couldn’t tell me anything about it because they didn’t know anything about it and I could not find anything online so I prayed a lot about it and cried a lot and decided about 2 days later that I had to take this leap of faith and trust that since he had made it this far, I truly believe he has been surrounded by angels since day one and he was meant to do something great in this life. We were flown on a private jet out of state to this new hospital. He had to be transferred on a private jet because an ambulance would have been an 18 hour commute and he could not fly commercial because he was not allowed to be around anyone, even all the nurses and anyone else who came in our isolation room had to wear a gown, mask, and gloves. My face was the only face he would see for almost the entire first year of his life. He still got sick just from being outside and breathing in the germs of the world. That day on the jet was the first time he had been outside and breathed in fresh air and felt the sunshine on his face in months, and the last time he would for a long time. Long story cut short, he received gene therapy and it worked. Eventually, he was making his very own T cells and he could go outside again on his first birthday. It was the best day of my life and I couldn’t be happier. It was nothing short of a miracle that he made it through all of that and we had a happy ending the way we did. I remember crying and thanking God for giving him a second chance at life. He was truly surrounded by angels since the first day of his life, there is no explanation as to how he had so many infections and lived through it with no way to fight it off by himself. By this time, of course it was confirmed that what we experienced that weekend was in fact a vaccine injury and of course it happened because his immune system could not fight off the vaccines like it was supposed to and that’s why it all happened that way. So, at the end I was right and it was a vaccine injury. I was able to get that on his medical records and also told that there would be no long term effects to his infections and injuries. No, my son is not autistic. No, he doesn’t have seizures all the time. And no, the injury didn’t happen because “big pharma” or because vaccines are bad. It happened because of his own immune system. Every time I have talked about this and I mean every single time, I’m always questioned “if your son was vaccine injured why are you not against vaccines?” What a stupid question. He was vaccine injured because of his immune system. I am not against vaccines because even though I now have a healthy almost 2 year old boy, he has not been cleared to be vaccinated yet, and herd immunity keeps him safe. It doesn’t take much research to understand why these things happen. And you’re damn right he will be receiving vaccines again as soon as I am given the okay by his doctor. Since his immune system is only getting better he will one day be able to receive vaccines and process them like any other healthy kid and I can’t wait for that day to come. So yes, my son was vaccine injured, and no, I am not an antivaxxer. Stop trying to use my story as “propaganda” for your stupid antivax agenda, which is harmful for people like him. I have so many regrets about the weekend he was injured, I should have just taken him to a different hospital. I should not have trusted them to give him the correct diagnosis. I knew something wasn’t right. If you ever feel like someone isn’t taking you seriously, please don’t make the mistakes I did, talk to someone who will. Please don’t ever go against your own instinct. This could have been fatal for my son and it’s nothing short of a miracle that it wasn’t. And for fucks sake, stop saying everything is a vaccine injury. Autism is hereditary and it cannot be contracted through anything, not even vaccines. Also, please vaccinate your fucking kids! If you read all of this thank you so much for letting me get this off my chest. If you take anything away from this, please just don’t be afraid to speak up and question anything especially when it comes to your kids. Edit: oh my gosh, thank you all so much for all the overwhelming support, I’m sorry I cannot reply to all of you but there is just so many comments! I will try to reply throughout the day. Thank you for all the positive comments, upvotes and thank you for all the medals! I’m surprised at how much support this has gotten! Thank you for listening to me, thank you for letting me get this off my chest. I have never told this whole story to anyone besides my family and my sons doctor because I felt like people would act just like how I have been treated in the past when I mentioned this and not believe me or think I’m just crazy. I honestly did not expect to draw this much attention. Cannot thank you guys enough for all the support. Also, if anyone finds out who we are, please don’t post any of our articles. I would like it if I could remain anonymous. UPDATE: I’m not going to debate anything about my sons condition or whether it was a vaccine injury or not. The person who diagnosed him has studied his condition for over 30 years, and is the same person who created the cure, and so I obviously have to trust her word. You can’t really diagnose anything based on a reddit post with only the facts from my memory and not the photos of the reaction that occurred, plus his full medical record, I don’t care if you’re a nurse, physician, doctor or rocket scientist. This post is nothing compared to actually going through this and seeing what happened in real life. It’s really hard to get the full perspective out in the right words. So, no, I’m sorry but I’m just not going to debate it. Naysayers and skeptics, I’m sorry but you can debate amongst yourselves. Vaccine reactions really DO happen, they just don’t all look the same. and is it really a reach to say an immuno compromised child was hurt because they were vaccinated when they shouldn’t have been? Medical negligence happens too, unfortunately. I have also countless hours of research on my sons condition, and believe me there is nothing I haven’t read about it yet on the internet. If there is a story out there about XSCID, I know about it. Anything on google you can find I have read it probably several times. I have also talked to many different doctors about it in depth as well. I have been given packets and packets and packets of information. Not trying to sound like a complete know it all, I am still learning things about it to this day, about his condition and gene therapy. But, I am a nerd when it comes to this stuff. I am very well informed because I did so much research while my son was in isolation. I sat on my computer all night sometimes just reading anything I could find that was related to his condition. I have also spoke with tons of other parents about this, I haven’t met a parent who’s child went undiagnosed and was vaccinated let alone had a reaction, and lived through it. Share stuff with each other about XScid- I love that you are all educating yourselves on this, I really do want to raise awareness, but just please don’t think that it’s some new information to me, or that it disproves my story. Believe me or not, like it or not, this is my story, I have no reason to come here and lie, I’m just a person who wanted to share my story anonymously. I also want to say I absolutely do not blame antivaxxers for how those people treated me that weekend in the emergency room. I don’t want to be lumped in with that group. I get flack from both sides. Either I’m a horrible mom because I will vaccinate even after my sons experience or I’m just a liar and my son had no reaction to a vaccine even though he had basically “no immune system” and it was confirmed by his doctor that it was a bad reaction due to his condition. I am pro vaccine and will continue to advocate. This experience was because of his condition and NOT because of the vaccine itself. I just can’t help but think back and wonder WHY I was treated like that. I can’t help but let my mind wander. Yeah, maybe I shouldn’t have been like “I think he was vaccine injured” THAT sounded bad but regardless, I feel like they didn’t take me seriously enough. Finally, I want to say that I 100% give all credit to the amazing doctors who created the gene therapy used on my son, my sons pediatrician, and all the nurses who took care of us for saving his life. Some moments, I just can’t help but think back and truly believe he was being looked after by angels, God, or some kind of positive spirits. I never had any type of faith I was never spiritual or religious at all until I saw miracles happen in my own life. So many kids have died because infections happen so quickly and they become sicker and sicker very fast. I see it all the time in support groups I’m in on different social media sites. One little girl recently went two weeks undiagnosed (ADA SCID) she got pneumonia and passed away at 3 weeks old. My heart breaks for these kids and it hurts so bad every time I see a story like that. I can’t help but think how it so easily could have been us and I’m very humbled that my son was able to leave that hospital with his life. HOW he went three months undiagnosed is almost unheard of. These babies suffer so badly you guys they really do. Newborn screening literally saves lives and if my son would have had the XSCID test on his newborn screen he would not have gone through any of this and would have been quarantined at birth. Thankfully they now have added SCID to newborn screening in all states in the US so my hope is that one day it will be worldwide and not just here in the US so absolutely nobody will have to go through this horror ever again. Thank you all for the comments, thank you so much for all the support and thank you to everyone who is educating yourself on my sons condition. Please continue to spread awareness and inform yourselves. Most of all, thank you for listening to my experience and giving me advice. I am now considering going forward with taking legal action against the hospital that was negligent towards my son, I think I am going to try and will update in the future when and if I do something about this. I really needed the support in this and you all have given me SO MUCH overwhelming support.

confessions,I sprinked nesquick all over my older brothers bed room and have caused an ant infestation because he's a really loud gamer and won't let me sleep at night. (self.confessions),"My older brother is 30. He has no job (hasn't worked since highschool), doesn't go to school, and lives with my parents still. All he does is make messes, and game all night. He games to the point that I can hear him yelling and screaming all night long, and its been a battle because I can not sleep with the amount of noise he has put out. Oh, also, I'm 17 and a female and will be moving out to my own apartment next Saturday for uni. Anyway, it started like any other night last night. Around 12am he started to game, turned his volume on his speakers all the way up, and was yelling and screaming into whatever he was playing and when I asked him to turn it down, it escalated and it turned into a telling match between us. Needless to say, he got angry and destroyed my bedroom door (punching it). I was at my breaking point. My parents don't care, I haven't slept properly for about a month, and so I devised my plan of vengeance. My brother went out early today with my aunt and left his door unlocked. So, sure, I could have messed his his computer and speakers, but I decided to do something more.. interesting. See. His room is dusty (not really messy, just dusty) and so, I sprinkled Nesquick powder, (like, the sweet chocolate powder) all over the dark dusty crevices of his room, and under his sheets, his shoes, and just pretty much anywhere that won't bring up too much suspicion. Well, the summer ant infestation that seems to come every year, has moved troops from the usually battle grounds of the kitchen and bathroom, into his room. When my brother got home, he absolutely freaked out. There where ants everywhere from what I heard in his tantrum. Ants in his bed, ants in his keyboard, ants in the computer. The ants where even having a frenzy in his closet from what I heard. To futher complicate this ordeal, I hid the ant killer, and since he can't drive, there was no way to really clear out the ants, and my parents don't get home until later tonight. So right now he's having a man baby tantrum because he can't play his game, whilst I enjoy my ant free environment in my bedroom. Tl;dr: 30 year old brother is a loud gaming jerk, so I sprinked a coat of nesquick in his room while he was gone to bring forth the ant invasion to his living crevice.",Computer_Salt,https://old.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/i5rkch/i_sprinked_nesquick_all_over_my_older_brothers/
confessions,I tricked my daughter and made her think I'm hip (self.confessions),"My teen-age daughter loves music. Its an integral part of her identity. I like 90's alt-rock and while she does too and has an eclectic taste in general, she prefers recent rap-hip hop (Travis Scott, Kid Cudi, Kanye, etc). When driving, I always told her whoever drove got to pick the music and anytime she gave me grief about what I would put on, I would switch it to stuff like Nat King Cole or Tom Jones or Yanni or sports talk and blast it. The other day, I took her to get her drivers license and she passed. So she's all excited and declares she's driving us home and as soon as she gets behind the wheel she informs me that the driver picks the tunes. I'm like, hey kid, you did great, you're the DJ. So she pulls up her rap playlist and off we go. As we're driving home, she's totally focused on the road, especially because we're on the freeway and the traffic is pretty heavy. I'm texting her mom and her brother and sister about how she passed and all that but also, every time a new song starts, I switch over and Shazam it. She has Apple Car Play up on the screen and Maps so no song info is visibly available. Then while the song is playing, at some point I casually ask ""hey, is this..."" and I'll name the artist and the exact mix version of the song. The first couple of times, she's like, yeah it is. Have I played it for you before? I tell her maybe, I've heard it somewhere. By the 4th or 5th song, she's like WTF, Dad, how do you know all of these??!!?

Flaws I didn't even realize drove me mad showed up suddenly. Dad reassuring me that he always hated him and always wanted someone better for me made things easier as well! I'm free in all of my decisions. I can pursue the job I want in a city of my choosing without having to look after what and where he wants to go. No more unnecessary fights. A feeling of new self worth after being constantly talked over/not being properly respected for 2 years. I can eat what I want, where and when I want without snarky comments. I can do yoga for hours without being ridiculed for it because it's not ""real activity"". Want to see my parents over the weekend? No one to stop me. Want to get drunk with my friends? No one giving me jealous comments. Having to hang out with people I don't like? No more! Endless talk of your stupid little schemes to improve the world without you even being able to get out of your fucking bed before 11 am? No thank you! Uncertain future because someone always refuses to plan even a month ahead? Gone! This is by far the easiest break up I ever had. So thanks for dumping me and giving my self respect back. I can't believe I let myself be controlled for that long. Never again! Goodbye energy sucker, you better save up all those tears.

If you came here solely because you wanted to know why I was dumped or why I didn't dump him first: it's in the comments but I'm gonna post it here as well so people will stop asking me about it: in the end our plans for the future didn't match, I wanted to move back to my hometown, he wanted to either migrate or live in a big city, none of us wanted to give in. I wanted to start a family sometime in the next few years, he panicked because he realized that we were in fact getting serious beyond the point of a college romance, I think you get the picture. I did think about dumping him for some time, but since we had ups and downs and it was, in fact, a loving relationship at first, I kept holding on in hopes of mending things I didn't realize were too broken. If you did have a really good relationship in the beginning it's hard to keep yourself from fighting for it and making a mistake by calling things off to soon. I did however emotionally distance myself from him for at least some time without actually realizing it until right before he did us both a favor and ended things. This is also why I believe I am not a miserable wreck like so many people want me to be. My dad helped me to realize a lot of these things, he really set my head right about it and helped me tremendously. What will I do once the regret kicks in? I don't know, probably nothing. I'm moving on to a really good job that I fought hard for in March, which has me also moving away 200 miles next week. Out of sight out of mind right? We'll see about that :) Thanks again everyone and cheers!

confessions,I like to creep around my home and act like a goblin (self.confessions),"I don’t know why but I just enjoy doing this. Maybe it’s my way of dealing with stress or something but I just do it about once every week. Generally I’ll carry around a sack and creep around in a sort of crouch-walking position making goblin noises, then I’ll walk around my house and pick up various different “trinkets” and put them in my bag while saying stuff like “I’ll be having that” and laughing maniacally in my goblin voice (“trinkets” can include anything from shit I find on the ground to cutlery or other utensils). The other day I was talking with my neighbours and they mentioned hearing weird noises like what I wrote about and I was just internally screaming the entire conversation. I’m 99% sure they don’t know it’s me but god that 1% chance is seriously weighing on my mind.",Sasuke-in-SSBU,https://old.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/ro9dfr/i_like_to_creep_around_my_home_and_act_like_a/

confessions,I tighten peoples water bottles when they piss me off (self.confessions),"I'm a personal trainer and this slippery slope of passive aggressive behavior started in college. I worked the university gym and my coworkers could be really pretentious. Id hear them talk shit about average Joe's just trying to get in shape or the typical shallow shit talking in general. Id wait patiently for them to walk away to do rounds or go to the bathroom. (Timing is everything with this scheme) When the time came Id make my move, squeezing and tightening to a brief exhaustion. Sometimes I'd peel skin off my hand. After I graduated I continued this behavoir at other gyms. My favorite target are racist old ladies that are deadset on making a good day a bad one cause they cant use their favorite recumbent bike.

confessions,I got into my car and almost drove away while my kids slept. (self.confessions),"Two years ago, my ex-wife Melanie (37F) and I (36M) separated. The divorce was a mutual decision made by the fact that she was cheating on me with a co-worker and wanted to be with him. We have five kids together, (13F) (12M), (10F), (8M) and (6M) and a cat. Based on several factors, she has weekly visitation and I have full custody of them, but doesn't ever show up for the visitation and seems to have given up on the children. I work as a teacher, an already exhuasting job as it is, and I spend every minute of my day either with my kids or kids that aren't mine, cooking and cleaning and breaking up fights and grading papers and then by the time the kids are asleep, the fucking (still love him though) cat wants attention and I want to scream from the top of my lungs. I'm tired. I'm fucking exhausted. I can't do this, I'm working and taking Care of six living, breathing beings and I feel betrayed and I'm so, so tired. Last night I stood up and walked out of the house, got in the car, and started it. The kids were asleep and I sat there, in the car, five seconds away from driving away. I wanted to drive away. I wanted to drive until I ran out of gas. And then I thought about my kids waking up and not having anybody around and I walked back inside. But I still want to run away. This morning I wanted to run away. I had to restrain myself from driving away while driving to work. I hate myself for being so quick to want to drive away from my kids. My kids, who I love more than anything in the world, were so quick to not having a father. This morning while I was driving to work I made peace that I wasn't going to drive away I wanted to veer off the road and into a ditch and die. I feel awful for this. I want to scream it from the rooftops.

confessions,I found out my girlfriend shits in the shower what do i do? (self.confessions),"Don't really know to get into this but I'll start by laying out a few details. So I've been dating this girl for about 4 months now and she is amazing ( up until I found out about this) like seriously amazing, both fallen hard for each other, I've met her family and she's met my limited family and it's been going great. She stays over a couple of times a week and I love her company and I'm very much In love with her. So finding out about this hit me quite hard and I've felt really weird since. I don't want to get into to much detail because its overall a pretty bizzare situation but basically at the start of the week she was at my place and we were chilling and caught up with the latest episode of the mandalorian (great TV show btw) and she goes off to take a shower which is normal after a day of work. So I'm chilling ln my room browsing Reddit and catching up with shit and I need to take a piss. I go to the bathroom and walk in to a room where I'm engulfed in the smell of shit and also it's steamy as hell in there. I'm taken a back clearly and trying to make sense of it because the toilet lid is down but the smell is so strong so I ask my girlfriend if she's okay, she says she's great and she's nearly done she's just trying to get rid of this. At this point I'm horrified and as I approach the shower curtain ( it's a black curtain so I can't see shit) I kinda realize what she's done and I pull back the curtain and she faces me to smile at me and I look down and there's about half a shit clogging up the drain and she's clearly been trying to stomp it down. I Had a lot of emotions running through my head all at once, horror, disgust and surprisement, mainly at her reaction of me walking in on her trying to waffle stomp a shit down the fucking drain, and I couldn't get my head around how cool and collected she was. I basically just said wtf are you doing and tbh her reply was more of surprise at my reaction of seeing what she was doing as in she didn't see the big deal about it and didn't get why I was so horrified. It was fucking weird. I left the bathroom obviously and we had a talk about it and she thought it was a normal thing to do. She needed a shit and just went for it. Apparently she was raised in a household where that was a normal thing to do and I just couldn't comprehend it. After a while talking she reassured me she didn't do it all the time but just whenever she needed a shit while in the shower. I tried explaining that this was definitely not normal or a cool thing to do whatsoever and she kinda flipped it back on me as if I was shaming her and got upset. Like i said I love this girl but this has properly rocked me and I don't know what to do. Sorry for poor grammar and formatting and how long this post is but I had to get this off my chest as I don't feel like telling anyone else and embarrassing her further.",johnymac8,https://old.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/e7no3b/i_found_out_my_girlfriend_shits_in_the_shower/
confessions,"(Update) I finally left my abusive parents, I’m at the airport now, waiting for a plane to take me 3,000 miles away with a one-way ticket. (self.confessions)","I’m posting an update to this: Part One as I know a lot of people asked me to keep updating. TL;DR: My family has been extremely abusive and toxic to me my entire life, including taking all of my money and telling everyone that I lied to them about my older brother molesting me when I was young (which did happen.) I am 23 years old. I’ve been dealing with severe physical abuse my entire life. I recently decided that I was moving to the other side of the country and not telling them anything. I changed my number and deleted all of my social media. I’m never coming back to this place. Ever. So I actually did it. I said goodbye to my few friends here, I packed all of my stuff in a suitcase. I read a post on this sub earlier where someone said “it’s funny how your entire life can fit inside a suitcase.” He was right, and you really start to feel bad when it comes down to this and you realize that you don’t need much of what you have at all. I was scared that the things I loved most wouldn’t all fit in my suitcase- I ended up having space leftover. Most of us live very selfishly. My little brother drove me here, to the airport. I love him, I hugged him and told him that I loved him, and I gave him my car, as he needed one for work and he’s never had much, either. My parents only really love my older brother, their firstborn. I told him that if our parents ask, to tell them that I asked him to take me to the airport, and I just gave him my car keys and left. He knows everything, but they don’t need to know that. I also gave him my fish, which oddly I already miss them. It’s really weird how taking care of even the smallest of creatures can make you feel so special. That helped a lot with my depression. I didn’t tell my parents anything. They don’t know anything. The last thing that my father said to me was “You need to cut the front yard” and he walked away. I don’t even remember the last thing that my mother said to me. I left them a note that said that I’m safe, I’m gonna be okay but I had to leave. I told them I would reach out when I was ready, if ever. I told them that I’ll always love them, for they are my parents and they gave me life. I wonder how they’re going to react when they see the note. I imagine my father will be furious as he can’t coerce me into giving him all of my money anymore. My mother is just going to use it to get pity, because her life is such a tragedy. At least, according to her book of faces. Perhaps they should’ve treated me better, as I’m the best son they could’ve ever asked for. I’m kind. I’m empathetic. I’m ambitious and I am full of love. But even I have my breaking point, and I’m going to find new people to give my love. People who will appreciate it. So anyways, yeah. I did it. I packed a suitcase that is my life, I grabbed the bracelet that my old friend who passed away gave me and put it around my wrist, I put on my favorite pair of beat up boots and cuffed my jeans, and I left. I’ll be so far away in 12 hours, they won’t ever be able to hurt me again. I randomly ran into my ex-boyfriend here at the airport, just a few minutes ago. We didn’t end things well when we broke up two years ago, coincidentally, it ended because he told me I was being ridiculous for rebelling against my parents abuse, and that I should be grateful to them, for even being alive. He was in a rush but he smiled and asked how I was doing, and he proposed that we should catch up when I got back from wherever I was going. I smiled at him, I told him I was doing well, and I said “I’ll let you know when I get back.” I feel very whole right now, for the first time in my life. EDIT: Wooooow!! My very first gold. Thank you so much!! I can’t believe how supported I am. Honestly, my emotions are all over the place but I can’t believe how many people are proud of me. This is genuinely the one single thing that I’ve wanted to do more than anything else in life- I was always so terrified to just take this leap of faith and hit the reset button and I’m almost in tears over how many people believe in me. I have no choice but to succeed now! 🙂 EDIT 2: And thank you for the silver as well! I’m going to take this opportunity to be my dramatic self haha and say that I genuinely am in tears in this airport at how supportive you all are. I cannot believe I JUST recently discovered Reddit. I was truly missing out. 😭 Also as an update, it’s 10:19AM and I am in NYC at the airport here. My flight was delayed but finally it took me from my home to here. In an hour, I’m boarding my flight to take me to my new home in California. 🙂🙂 EDIT 3: I am moving to Los Angeles. My parents don’t know yet but will definitely update when they find out. My brother and I are in close communication about this. I do have somewhere to stay when I get there, no job yet but that’ll be easy. I just wanted to answer some questions that I was getting a lot. I was married when I was younger and we moved away, got divorced 2 years and a few months ago. I never thought I would have to explain and justify 23 years of abuse because one or two assholes on here wanted to call me a liar. Can’t imagine being that hateful to a stranger. Thank you though to everyone else that is supportive though! I took a picture 🙂 Final update for this post: i have arrived in LA at 2:47pm. the air here is amazing. i feel completely renewed and i’ve been here for 10 minutes. it’s so beautiful. anyways, i’m gonna drop my stuff off and take a hike with my best friend. thanks for listening. until next time!",LetMeBeGay,https://old.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/b7wi7z/update_i_finally_left_my_abusive_parents_im_at/

confessions,Showed a drunk stranger my boobs for $500 (self.confessions),"I was 22 at the time and tending bar. There was this really hot married guy (about mid 30's) who would come in around 6pm every weekday. He always wore a suit and smelled amazing. He never said anything except his drink order. He'd drink several shots of whatever the special was, leave a $10 tip then leave. One Friday he came in. I noticed he wasn't wearing his wedding ring. He kept ordering beer which was strange. He sat there until closing. I told him we were closing and offered to call him a cab. He looked me in my eyes and said I'll pay you $500 if you show me your tits. I was surprised and said nothing. He told me how his wife had been cheating on him with his best friend for months and he hadn't seen tits in a while. That he thought about my boobs a lot and wondered what they looked like. I joked that he could get a woman to have sex with him for that much. He didn't laugh and told me he was serious. He just wanted to see my boobs and didn't want to do anything else. Then he slapped 5 hundred dollar bills on the bar. That's when I realized he was serious. I took the money then I told him to meet me in the men's bathroom in 5 minutes. I told the bouncer what was going on in case he tried to do more than see my boobs. He shrugged and said to yell hot pepper if things went wrong. I went into the bathroom where he was waiting, leaned against the door then lifted my shirt and bra. He stood there looking at my boobs for what seemed like forever. It was like 1 minute. I asked him if he seen enough. He nodded then said they're better than I imagined. Thanks. I fixed everything then left. He came out about 10 minutes later. He never came back to the bar. Until now I've never told another soul about it. EDIT: this is a throwaway account.",,https://old.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/9bn9t0/showed_a_drunk_stranger_my_boobs_for_500/
confessions,My wife died. That bitch (self.confessions),"We were having serious issues and then she got sick with cancer. That came like a mack truck. She said a lot of the grief she gave me was because she knew she was sick and was ashamed of burdening me and leaving me as a widow dad of four kids under 13. I took care of that woman like she was one of my boys. That experience took 10 years off my life. Her death was easy compared to the aftermath. I was going through her computer and saw that she had a separate email account which was odd. That was on purpose. This bitch was planning on blindsiding with a divorce and was going back and forth with different lawyers about making me a weekend dad, throwing me out of my house and even seeing if I'd pay her legal bills. This went on a week before she saw the doctor. This slag used me to take care of her in her final days because no one else would.

adultery,"This sub keeps me faithful🖕😤🖕""I'm better than all of you!"" (self.adultery)","So, I’ve been here for a few weeks now as I still struggle with remaining honest and not seeking sexual intrigue outside of my long term marriage. I relate to a lot of what I see expressed here: the rationalizations, self-delusion, true intimacy avoidance, and painfully powerful addictive impulses that fuel this “lifestyle” the euphemism some here like to use. When I come here, I see all the sadness and pain — the attachment wounds, the fear of intimacy, the desperate and futile search for validation through sexual attention, the search for power too — that allow me to feel self compassion for my own impulses. I also see the mind boggling selfishness, narcissism, and lack of empathy for our betrayed spouses, the crippling emotional immaturity and breathtaking cluelessness about the children involved. I too have been there. Most of all I see the escape from reality. The attempt to escape. It’s understandable, wanting to connect, being attracted to others. And there are options, like ethical consensual non monogamy and polyamory to explore in new relationships for those who have the maturity and self knowledge to truly do it with the integrrity. This is not a lifestyle, it’s a life dysfunction. For many of us, there is a compulsive, trauma based reason we need therapy for. For a few, it’s unapologetic narcissism (that guy who is always stating he would not tolerate “invasion of privacy” - that’s it’s sacrosanct to his marriage while literally having sex with other women and risking her physical health! Amazing). Most if us are just fucked up and fooling ourselves. Yet reality will win eventually. Get help, seek therapy, read books, get divorced, but stop pretending that lying and having sex behind your spouses backs is safe or ok.

adultery,To the DB adulterers... I see you (self.adultery),"My AP is in a DB. I am not. And I think I'm only just beginning to comprehend the full extent of what that means for some of you... A couple meets ago I got carried away and left some small scratches on his back. I panicked, but he just looked at me kind of sadly and smiled and said I shouldn't worry about them being seen. And that's when I started to realise... That she doesn't see him naked. She's never close enough to notice a few red marks on his back or chest. She doesn't hold him, or kiss him, or tell him how good he looks. She's never even close enough for him to worry much about my scent on him. AP is a fucking beautiful specimen of a man. He's kind, he's clever, he's attentive and he's phenomenal in bed. And I know that there are two sides to every story, but the thought of him having been deprived of that touch for so long makes me immeasurably sad. So to those of you out there in the same boat, hang in there. I hope there's someone out there for you who will take as much pleasure as I do in bringing that affection, and connection, to the table.

adultery,Men: PSA on orgasms (self.adultery),"Many of you men know this, I’m sure, but for those who don’t (and there are a shocking number of you), here’s a PSA on orgasms for women: use. her. mind. It’s our most important erogenous zone. (Disclaimer about women not being monolithic, etc.). For so many women, sex is so very psychological. You might have the best lips and tongue in the world, but if you’re not stimulating her brain, you’re missing out. My favorite kind of foreplay is mental. You can touch me or lick me or kiss me just right, but if you haven’t set the stage with mental foreplay, the chances of me cumming go down as does the likely size of any orgasm I do have. You want to make me cum so hard I feel like I’m hit with a tsunami? Start screwing my brain long before we’re even in the same room together. Text me when I’m at work. Start telling me in the morning subtle little dirty things. Get less and less subtle throughout the day. Tell me what you’re going to do. Tell me what you want me to do. Compliment me in a dirty way. Don’t assume things go without saying. Yes, if we’re having sex, I know you’re attracted to me. That doesn’t mean I don’t want to hear it. Make me feel sexy. Make me feel wanted. Make me feel like there is nowhere you would rather be than inside me, in my mouth, or your head between my legs. Tease me. Tell me you stole away recently to play with yourself thinking of me. Tell me how much it turns you on to see me naked. Tell me how good it feels when I swirl my tongue around your head or when you slide all the way into my mouth. Tell me how much you love the way I taste. Do those things and you’ll have me in a whimpering puddle. If you’re with a woman and you want to blow her mind, be sure to use her mind.",Wantonmouth,https://old.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/cuft6n/men_psa_on_orgasms/

adultery,I don’t know why I cheated for the first time. But I do know why I have continued to cheat. (self.adultery),"The first time we slept together he told me “I’ve wanted this for so long”, and “You’re so amazing” and then held me all night. Even now he praises me the entire time we’re together and takes any opportunity he can get for us to spend the night next to each other. The last time you and I had sex, you said “thanks”, wiped yourself off, and went about your day. When I sleep close to you, you complain about my hair tickling or irritating you and you move away. He kisses me. Deep, passionately, before, during, and after. My lips, my neck, my collarbone and more. You give me a quick peck to say hello and goodbye. Never closing your eyes, never lingering for half a second. He touches me. He cups and gently squeezes my breasts before gently kissing my nipples. He caresses my tummy and hips and makes me appreciate the parts of myself I hate, all because his hands wander there. You hardly ever even look at, let alone touch my “ruined boobs” as you call them, supposedly jokingly. You either place your hands behind your head, on either side of me, or occasionally on my knees or lower back. He looks at me. He tries to catch my eyes with his both in public and when we’re alone. You close your eyes so tight during sex I can’t help wondering who you’re thinking about. He looks for me. Even at busy crowded get togethers he’s not at ease until he finds me and knows I’m there. Our last trip together I fell behind your pace while walking with you and you didn’t notice for 7 minutes. We talk and share our days, our experiences, ambitions, desires with one another. He remembers little things I mentioned to him years ago. I can’t get a word in edgewise when you’re talking to me. When I try to start a conversation with you, you often don’t even realize I’m speaking, or you ask “were you saying something?” after I give up trying to get your attention. He makes me feel seen, wanted, beautiful, sexy, important, smart, and frankly I can’t ever get enough of him. You make me feel like I’ve wasted 9 years. You make me wonder why I couldn’t have met him first, and if I’ll ever get the courage to leave and let myself be loved to my full potential.",,https://old.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/aevsym/i_dont_know_why_i_cheated_for_the_first_time_but/
adultery,PSA for men in their 40s... (self.adultery),"Y'all. Y'ALL. Y'all know that the world of fucking is your oyster, right? Act like it! Here's the thing. You guys are nearly EVERY woman's fantasy, across all age groups. Y'all have been around long enough to: know how to fuck properly, develop some sense of maturity and practicality, develop both your sweet and salty sides, know how to use your words(generally) when needed, figure out what cologne works for you(your scent game is life), figure out your facial hair game, and develop some sort of vision for your life(even if it's not totally clear or perfect). Unless you've just been a total waste of space for the last 20 years, you guys should not be in a situation where you aren't getting laid regularly! Guys younger than you are ground beef, and guys older than you are cube steaks, and YOU GUYS ARE PRIME FUCKING RIB. And ground beef is great for meatloaf, but it needs a whole lot of other shit in it. And cube steaks are awesome, but too fucking tough. We want really good fucking steak! We want prime rib! So, start taking care of yourselves. Get to the gym. Find your perfect cologne. Fix your beard. Talk to us. Make us laugh. Use words like 'twitterpated' in the totally right context and make our panties drop. Mindfuck us(in a good way) and then FUCK us. Start acting like the kings that you are and stop moping! Wake up! Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk. Edit: Lots of people in the comments and my inbox seem to think I'm a 40yo woman.....I'm 26 y'all. Although, now I can't wait to be 40 and killing it!

adultery,How to help your SO see his AP (self.adultery),"For you who follow my posts know my husband has an AP. I have an AP. Differance is I know about his AP. He has no clue about mine. Sunday is hubbies golfing day and by golfing I mean it is his day to fornicate with his AP. And when he goes golfing, I get to see my AP. ""Golfing"" is his only exuse by the way (you guys diversify!!). Saturday evening we watch the news and GASP heavy rain is predicted in our area. I see hubby is not happy. Heavy rain with possible thunder = no ""golfing"". Enter SULK, SIGH, SULK SULK. Him: ""there goes golfing I guess"" followed by a loud sigh. I guess he is staying at home. What is a horny for her AP wify to do? The next morning after breakfast I tell him I have a surprise for him. I know he has been working hard lately and needs a day off to relax just on his own. I tell him I have booked him a ticket to see the new Matrix movie that he wanted to see. The nearest theater is at least one hour drive. I calculated that the movie is 2.5 h and add to that at least 2 h drive and 1 h extra so he makes it on time. Oh I also booked it at the far end of the nearest city for good measure (extra driving for him). I see his face light up. He is doing the calculations too. I can feel a pinch of guilt on his part. This nice gesture earns me a hug, puppy eyes of gratitude, kiss and some well chosen words of endearment that would make any wifes heart melt. As I watch hubby drive off, I start bruning rubber to my AP's casa. Three orgasms later I head home to start dinner and I think I must have earnt me the ""wife of the year award"". Now if my husband ever complains I don't meet his needs I can draw his memory back to a rainy Sunday I made sure his AP gave him a BJ. Every man should have a wife like me 😈.",jameswifethrowaway,https://old.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/sxqw2r/how_to_help_your_so_see_his_ap/
adultery,I went to the edge of cheating and then backed out (and I'm glad) (self.adultery),"I've been lurking here for a long time, and I have told (under other throwaways) the story of my long-running crush on a former colleague. The consensus on this sub was about 50/50 whether or not I should cheat. Recently crush and I have been spending a lot of time together, alone and with a friend group. I'd had some casual touches with my crush, but he was definitely holding back. We texted quite a bit -- never sexting, but flirty. I was becoming downright obsessed. I download a counter app on my phone and would tap it every time I thought of him or thought of texting him. I got up to 48 before lunch. I also tried to ""let him text first.... let him text first...."" but always broke down and sent something, either to the group chat and aimed at him or to him directly And then, almost suddenly, the crush lifted. Why? My husband noticed and cared that I was spending time elsewhere with other guys I don't have a dead bedroom, and my husband has been willing to play along with some fantasy stuff (See #1) The more time I spent around said crush, the more I found things to be turned off by. The perfection I had created was nowhere near real. I suddenly felt I really want this person in my life for the long-term as a friend. He's a fabulous, rock solid friend. I pictured hanging out over the summer with the work group and my husband, and I think we'd have a good time. I started talking about my husband more at the group gatherings. I realized I never walked into that space as an available woman. They all know my status. I also pictured my life 5, 10, 20 years from now, having cheated and having not. Having not is SO much better. pAP is single and not done dating or looking for relationships. I want to be able to hang out with whoever he partners up with. My husband injured his hand and can't wear his wedding ring, so I'm wearing it for him on my right-hand middle finger. My rings on the left hand. His ring on the right. It's been a powerful reminder of what we have. I'm not advising people to go one way or another in your adultery decisions, but I have appreciated reading how other people think, and I thought someone might be interested in mine.",CarPoolLaneThrowaway,https://old.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/bbecaf/i_went_to_the_edge_of_cheating_and_then_backed/
adultery,This is why I'm having an affair🌬️Ventilation💨 (self.adultery),"Last night I went out with my husband. He wanted to drink, so I was the designated driver. I'm cool with that. I like to drink, but I also want to be safe. The one thing I made him promise was to not get sloppy fall down drunk, something he has been guilty of in the past, a lot. Well, BIG surprise, he got sloppy fall down drunk. He had trouble waking and getting into the car. Got mad at me on the ride home for wanting him to put on his seat belt. Wanted me to drop him off about 10 miles from home because he said he'd rather walk home (I didn't, of course). I hate it when this happens. It feels like I married a child, except this is a man sized child that I have to take care of. It gives me the ick and makes me resentful. Plus, I'm expected to just forgive and forget... ""I didn't mean to get that drunk... I'm sorry"" We've been married for 22 years and for the first 20, I was faithful. But for what? To be treated like a mom that has to clean up, schedule everything, cook, etc for a grown man... with nothing in return. The last two years have let me find myself again. I had forgotten my likes and desires because I have prioritize everyone else in my life, but me. Honestly, I'm not sure why I'm posting this. I guess, I feel more confident in my decision to step out and enjoy life while I can. Life is too short to forget yourself.",Immasecret78,https://old.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/1d1i3e0/this_is_why_im_having_an_affair/
adultery,I [37] caught my wife [43] cheating two years ago and haven't stopped her. (self.adultery),"UPDATE: What an incredible array of conversations I've had today. I'm so deeply grateful to all of you who chimed in on this situation. I plan to re-read the entire thing today and tomorrow, but I still would deeply value additional insights if you want to add something. The tally of ""tell her"" vs. ""Don't tell her"" was bewildering to me. I wasn't nearly expecting such an even split, but I don't really know what I was expecting. You have no idea how much gratitude I have to all of you who took the time to share your thoughts on this. I'm somewhat leaning towards telling her, but only gradually, and there will be an immense ""leading with love"" approach if I go that route. All day long, I've been moved deeply by surging waves of how much I love her and how much I love our life together. She's incredible and I wake up grateful every single day to be with her, even during the past two years when I have known she was up to this. My overwhelming gratitude to wake up next to her has never wavered, even knowing what I know. I welcome ongoing comments, of course, and will consider future posts if this progresses in a specific direction. UPDATE 2: Please do not delete your comments, please! I need to re-read this! Update 3: She's in a hilariously great mood tonight. Cooking dinner, sipping wine, chatting away. I've had this wild day in here and she's just like ""la di da!"" It's adorable and she's so wonderful and sexy. Update 4: I have been doom scrolling this reddit for like 17 of the last 24 hours. I'm gonna put my phone away for a bit and have a think about stuff. Update 5: thanks everyone. I will send an update in the coming weeks if this situation changes. I have a few ideas that are gentle and non-invasive in mind. A few years ago, I was on my lunch break and was out on a drive. I popped by my house and my garage door was open and my wife's car and another car were there. I parked across the street and went in through the garage, which is in our basement, essentially under the bedrooms of our split level house. Literally the second I was in the garage, I could hear the bed in our spare bedroom above me bouncing and muffled sounds that were clearly sex. I stood there, basically in disbelief of what I was hearing, but I wasn't overcome with anger or anything. I very very quietly opened the door into the house and crept up the steps. I could see down the hall from the top of the steps and I could see the shadows of fucking on the wall outside the first bedroom (not my bedroom) in the hallway. Tons of groaning, lots of dirty talk from her, and I snuck back down the steps, through the garage, out to my car, and backed it to a side street and I observed them leave about 15 minutes later. They just walked out in broad daylight. The thing is....our marriage is fucking awesome. Like, totally spot on amazing. We have sex almost every night and we're completely in love. We have 3 kids together and life is damn good. Over the past couple of years, I sporadically pop past the house in the middle of the day and that car is there about 2-3x a month and I am 100% aware of what is happening.....and I'm kinda okay with it! Oh, and I know who the guy is, too. I had a police pal run the plate and it's one of her college boyfriends. He's also married. My plan for now is if she ever finds out I know, I'm just going to tell her I'm fine with it because our marriage is pretty much bang on perfect. If this is what she needs to do to keep the marriage perfect, I'm fine with it and I won't cause any drama to her FWB. What do you all think? Anyone else have this type of situation? Am I a total weirdo?",,https://old.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/jfd3kr/i_37_caught_my_wife_43_cheating_two_years_ago_and/
adultery,How I ended up knitting a sweater for AP’s wife.😄 How to Knit an APerican Quilt (self.adultery),"For Xmas I knit AP a sweater. It was nice. Cashmere yarn. AP told his wife that a girl at work was knitting them for extra cash so he decided to buy one (we don’t work together, this was just his excuse as to how he ended up with a really cool hand knit sweater). Whelp…..she LOVED it! And ordered one for herself. So here I am knitting a sweater for my AP’s wife. I’m not even mad. It’s just too funny.

adultery,Your wife’s just not that into you (self.adultery),"I see so many men on here saying how great their relationship is at home besides sex. They love their wife, they make great partners even though they are sleeping in separate rooms and their wives keep turning down their advances. Let me let you in on a secret. Your wife just isn’t that into you... (Disclaimer: I’m not saying this is the case for everyone but it is for a lot) I have been turning down sex from my husband for years. I finally after all this time figured out I do not like him. I thought I just didn’t like sex, but with my AP I wanted to have sex ALL the time. I’m unhappy at home and that manifests itself into not wanting anything physical. Think about this logically, you can’t want to be disconnected from someone you truly love... You may have some care for that person but you really don’t love them if you don’t ever want to touch them. Add to that - you are repulsed by them. If your wife is disconnected in sex she’s disconnected from you, it’s that simple. Oh ya hormones, autoimmune diseases - I have that too but they are just excuses. Excuses not to touch you because you are not wanted in that way. So think about that the next time you say how amazing your relationship is and that your wife is so great except sex. Except sex... sex is huge, it’s the glue that holds people together. Once that’s done your spouse is now just a friend, if that. There’s the secret that’s been let out of the bag. Thought I’d share Side edit: if she gets horny only when she’s drunk she’s trying to give you sex to keep things going but doesn’t want to be present for the experience. I’m drunk now so we can get this over with and he can be happy for the next 5 months.",princessgladys1,https://old.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/lo6th6/your_wifes_just_not_that_into_you/

adultery,"Update to ""I [37] caught my wife [43] cheating two years ago and haven't stopped her."" (self.adultery)","Here is my original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/jfd3kr/i_37_caught_my_wife_43_cheating_two_years_ago_and/ Well, woke up at 4 am, so might as well type this out! The last month or so has been a whirlwind for me. First, thank you from the bottom of my heart for the tremendous amounts of supportive messages I received from this sub. There were so many amazing pieces of advice. When I wrote the post, I wasn't sure if I would ever tell her, but a series of events occurred in recent weeks that now have me convinced I made that post in part because i was ready to talk to her about it, but didn't know how until the perfect situation fell into my lap last week. And I have told her. In the weeks after I made my post, I found myself obsessing over clues of their routine. They met up a couple of times on either a Tuesday or a Thursday, always at my house, and always for only about 30-40 minutes. Each time, she sent me a late morning ""Hey, how's your day?"" text to check that I was firmly ensconced at work. Each time, I ran to my car and drove up a side street to view my house from afar. After watching them go inside, I then would pop over to the house, hear the telltale sounds from the guest bedroom. Once, after they had gone, I snuck into the house to find the laundry machine running and the guest bed re-made with a fresh sheet. I took one of my kids to dance lesson later that day, came home, and that sheet had been put back away in the hall closet. I also found myself watching her phone habits. She's very anti-phone during family time, but I noticed her on her phone between sets when she weight lifts on Sunday nights in our basement. I found this behavior of mine weighing on me. I didn't really care for my voyeuristic behavior. But this past Thursday, a seemingly meant-to-be series of events occurred for a ""now or never"" opportunity for me to act. I got ""the text"" at 10:30 or so in the morning. I ran to the car, arrived at my house at 10:45. Most of the time, they get there at 11:00 (my wife goes to work at 6:30 am so she has an early-ish lunch); he arrived at 11:00, but she didn't arrive until 11:05. They went in through garage as normal (left it open as normal, too). I'll be brief here, but I went into the house and came close to getting caught. But they were later than normal and apparently in a huge hurry, and, upon re-entering the house after they'd gone, discovered she had NOT replaced the sheets on the spared bedroom bed and had NOT started the laundry. In the laundry were the sheet, a pair of panties, and a pair of scrubs lab pants and shirt. Almost as if I had no control over the situation, I started the laundry machine, sat down, had coffee, and moved the laundry over to the dryer half an hour later, and then went back to work. I took one of my kids to their dance class that day, got home at like 6:30, and walked in to an absolutely frantic wife. She grabbed hold of my arms, looked at me, was shaking, and said ""Did something happen today?"" I looked her in the eye, said ""Yes, I love you, everything is fine, we will talk about it all a lot, i love you, it's okay, i promise it's okay."" I kissed her and we fooled around in the bathroom for a few minutes, then I made dinner, and we helped the kids with homework, bedtime, etc. as normal. When the kids got to bed, we got down to business and talked for about 5 hours Thursday night. It basically started off by her asking me ""How much do you know?"" I told her a LOT, but not even remotely everything, and also that I wasn't mad at all. She said she had spent every waking moment from getting home and discovering the laundry to the time I walked in feeling almost certain I would walk in and announce I was divorcing her. I assured her that was NOT going to happen. Of course she was rattled. She admitted everything straight away, was very upset obviously, but I got her calmed down and we had some fantastic conversation. We agreed we'd likely need a weekend of privacy and my MIL agreed to take the kids all weekend, which is perfect because the kids just go there and eat Papa Johns and snickers ice cream bars for two days so they love it of course. So the gist of what I found out is this: -It's been going on since 2005, pre-dating me knowing her by five years. -They dated in 1996 and didn't have a great relationship but the sex was great. -They reconnected after he'd been married 3-4 years and began cheating. she was a single AP but he was married. -She told me she would have been content to do that for years, and did. She dated casually with other people, hooked up with him, became a doctor, did her residency, traveled, had a good life. When she met me ten years ago, I complicated her equation because of how intensely she fell in love with me. She gave me her full self, but continued with him because of what described as ""magic hex she couldn't break"" regarding their sexual chemistry. -My kids are 100% mine (I never had any doubt really) and they never had PIV intercourse while we were trying to conceive. -He and his wife have a great marriage, have sex, and my wife is not saving him from a dead bedroom. -His wife does not know. -Their relationship essentially consists of ""hey, how's it going? how's life? how are the kids, FUCK ME NOW!, okay see ya next time!"" It's not an overly emotional thing. She explained several times that if they were going to have a real relationship, they would have done it long before she and I even met. Obviously there is a lot more that I know than that list, but you get the idea. We also had sex like 10 times this weekend when the kids were gone. I clearly told her I am okay with it if she and he continue; I love her, she has had this thing going for much longer than I've been married to her, it makes her happy, and I love it when she's happy. She was, of course, gobsmacked. I also told her she is free to NOT tell him I know OR to tell him I know and that telling him or not was 100% in her court. She mulled it over, considered it for a day, and decided to tell him. I told her if she wanted to tell him, she could invite him over this past Sunday morning, I would go for a long run, they could talk, then I would go pick up the kids and when returning with the kids, he would be gone. And that's what happened. I got home with the kids in the late morning, she saw them, cried. The kids went to put away to play. My wife is. weightlifter is insanely strong. We frequently do muay thai holds in bed, haha. She could kick the shit out of me in two seconds flat. But she grabbed my head on both sides of my face HARD. And the tears just flowed from both of us instantly. Just GUSHING. She looked me straight in the eye and said ""You have to listen to me. I will NEVER leave you. EVER. I LOVE YOU...and you know it."" Well, I fucking sobbed like a baby. So she recapped their conversation to me. She started the conversation by telling him to stay calm, everything was fine, but that she felt it pertinent to tell him that I knew everything and had known for a long time. He said okay. She told him that the option was on the table to continue but that at the end of the conversation if he decided he could not trust ME that she was ending it with HIM. He said okay. So she relayed to him what I knew. It was a couple hour long conversation. Sunday afternoon, she checked in with him and he said he was doing fine. He said that he did trust me because if I had an malicious intent towards him, his life as he knew it would have ended long ago. He also sent her a message to relay to me that he does trust me and he hopes that I will trust him as well and know in my heart that he is not coming for what I have. He will never steal my wife away. So he said he trusts me and he asked me to trust him. I said he had a deal. She has been very communicative with me (as she always is) but to a new level. She has expressed relief to me the past couple of days that she feels lighter. She has showed me numerous times in recent days how much she loves me. She is having moments of struggle because this is all still so fresh for her, whereas i've been living with it for years. She's amazed at how I'm fine. I told her I'm fine because we're together and I know she's in this with me. She said yes she is. And that brings us up to date.

adultery,A word of advice to those who are unmarried: (self.adultery),"There seems to have been an influx of posts here recently of unmarried people, maybe engaged or in relationships that are less than 5 years long, looking to cheat. I believe this is the one issue that would unite SI and this sub. I can’t imagine that I don’t speak for most people on both subs when I say: If you find yourself wanting to cheat on your SO, for the love of God, DON’T GET MARRIED!!! If you’re in college and your girlfriend doesn’t put out, go find one who does. What in the hell keeps you in this relationship? You’re not bound to anyone legally, financially, or through children. The only thing keeping you together is the fact that you say you want to be together. The ones that kill me are the ones who are engaged, both here and on DB. “My fiancé won’t have sex with me anymore.” You’d better seriously reconsider that fiancé thing then. This marriage shit is HARD. And I went in to mine with a man who was my best friend, and intellectual equal, we share similar religious and philosophical views, enjoyed each other’s company, talked non-stop, had matching libidos, and laughed constantly. Now I can’t say most of those things are true. I couldn’t imagine having been married 15 years to someone I was already complaining about and unsatisfied with before I got married. Leave the relationship. It’s idiocy for you and it’s unfair to the other person. If you’re cheating and you’re not even married, all you’re doing is wasting the other person’s time and abusing their emotional investment.",hothrams,https://old.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/okq155/a_word_of_advice_to_those_who_are_unmarried/
adultery,I understand now🌬️Ventilation💨 (self.adultery),"Seeing my buddy’s marriage I understand now. He works full time, cooks and cleans while his wife brags on Facebook how she’s a princess and doesn’t have to do anything. He takes care of the kids while she has let herself go, watching tv all day and eating. He’s asked her to get a job, find a hobby and even counseling to help her but she thinks everything in their marriage is perfect. He still tries to initiate sex with her and is always turned down. He said it’s harder and harder to find her attractive as she’s gone from 150lbs to 275 lbs. She yells, belittles him and yet the husband has been faithful this whole time. But now I see...I see things changing. I see how he’s connected with someone as friends that’s turning into something more. The friend values his opinions, doesn’t dismiss his feelings, makes him feel attractive and wanted. I see my friend falling for her. I see my buddy excited for life again. I never understood before how affairs happened but through my buddies eyes I see exactly how and why.",epicbaconator,https://old.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/mti2yv/i_understand_now/
adultery,A Window Into The Affair-Minded Woman🎬 Another Take 🎬 (self.adultery),"I have been musing about this for some time, and I just really want to make it explicit for the men on here searching for an AP, because I think if more men understand this it will lead to more success for all of us. If you’re wondering what many—not all!—women want in their APs, I think it really boils down to one, deceptively simple concept: ::We want to be the object of your desire and affection:: What does this mean? Well…it means that we want to be shown, without doubt or hesitation, that we are SEEN, and that we have been deemed worthy, that we are special…at least to YOU. So many of us women searching for affairs are driven to do so because we are ignored, taken for granted. We want you to look at us and KNOW that you truly desire us, that we aren’t another notch on a belt, or just a way to pass the time and fight boredom. What are some ways to prove this to a woman? Treat her like a human, not a sex object. Don’t joke about her sneaking into your vacation home for sex five minutes into a conversation. Give her sincere and straightforward, non-flowery compliments, especially after she sends you a picture, but also for other things and all the ways you enjoy her conversation, humor, smell, presence, body, etc. Remember the things she tells you and follow up on them. More than anything, be kind and sincere and simple when showing the joy and contentment she brings you. These things will go such a long way toward not only making her comfortable, but really these sincere gestures end up being an act of SEDUCTION. I promise you. View her truly as a fascinating human, find joy and excitement in HER, NOT just in order to have sex, and she is so much more likely to give it back. We aren’t looking for Prince Charming, but we are looking to be appreciated.",,https://old.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/vs4act/a_window_into_the_affairminded_woman/

adultery,I’m getting a divorce. Farewell to you all. (self.adultery),"This is my farewell to the adultery world. I’m no longer pursuing this secret life. In the last three years I have talked to probably almost 100 of you on Reddit and most of you were lovely. A few of you were shitty humans and put me down when I felt my lowest. To you I wish a world where your house smells terrible yet you can’t find the source of the odor. It’s been fun. But it ain’t been that fun. With my farewell to you all I leave a few words of advice to any new people in this shitty world of adultery. If someone is an asshole to you, delete them and don’t respond. You don’t know the lows people are feeling and why they snapped so easily. Let them go. Don’t judge. Part of my journey my wife had no idea I cheated. But leading up to our divorce my wife and I were in an open relationship. Often times I found myself not belonging anywhere. We all want to belong. Don’t judge someone’s situation and just try to understand. For the guys on here, my best advice is to be funny. Humor goes a lot way and got me lots of messages. Treat this world like fishing. If a woman isn’t feeling you, turn her loose and throw the line back in. But always make people laugh. Your real identity is sacred, always protect it. Be someone on here that you can’t be in real life. Reddit was and still is a refuge for me. I became a new person who said things I couldn’t say in the real world. I could be myself on here when I often felt I couldn’t be at home. Protect yourself. Get the divorce. I had a wonderful marriage. We were prom dates in high school and each other’s first loves. We are still remaining friends. We just don’t have the same goals in life and we both refuse to ever be a reason the other can’t find full happiness in life. Many of you want to leave your spouse and many of you are in very abusive relationships. Get out. Your kids will be fine. They are already growing up in a world which will fuck them up plenty enough without your help. They’re going to be depressed regardless of who mommy and daddy are sleeping with . Show them that if one day they themselves are trapped in a dead-end marriage, they too can get out and find happiness and a second chance at love. You will be dead very soon and there’s probably another warm human who’d love to know what’s going on in that big brain of yours. Maybe he or she is waiting for you to ask them to lunch. Do it. I don’t think I’ll ever get married again. But I probably will find love. Love is not patient, it comes randomly and it is usually fleeting. Your best bet is to be a surfer and ride the wave until you wipe out and get water shot up your nose. Resurface, have a laugh, and go find a new wave. Last but not least, because I am unoriginal, I quote a man who’s seen the worst of mankind every day on network television, Jerry Springer: “Take care of yourselves, and each other.”",SnooApples7237,https://old.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/ntvyzq/im_getting_a_divorce_farewell_to_you_all/
adultery,No more cheating in 2020 (self.adultery),"First: Thank you so much to this community. It has been a place of sanity and solace for me. I appreciate every single person who was brave enough to put in writing their pain, joy, desires, happiness, sadness, goals. Second: To my SO, you don't know it but this is the year I pull the plug. We have been together for almost 2 decades. We tried. Jesus, we made it longer despite everyone at our wedding smiling and predicting we would be divorced within a year. The biggest take-away from our marriage is that sometimes a guy/girl should be friends and only friends. I hope we can still be friends. I don't want to say we ""failed"" at marriage. We both put a lot into this relationship but we are 100% incompatible. Our children are beautiful and I know they love you. While our parenting style isn't compatible in the same household, it will be our strength in our divorce. I wish you luck in whatever future romantic relationships you have. I hope you do the work to allow a healthy relationship to happen. I don't love you but I do care about you. My door is always open for whatever mess you get yourself into. I will always support you, no matter how hard I roll my eyes at whatever fuckery you have gotten yourself into. Third: To my AP, you don't know this but I have already dumped you. It will take awhile for you to figure it out. I predict mid Jan when I don't sent a Happy Birthday to you, you will start wondering what is up. I loved you. Really, really loved you but I don't want to be your AP anymore. We are incompatible. A cake eater with a DB. You have been my only lover for longer than I'm willing to admit. You don't know this because I just can't bring myself to tell you. Thank you for reaffirming I am sexy and desirable. To be honest you are the only person who could have successfully gotten this through my head. You will always be special in my life. I'm not going to ghost you because I believe in friendly endings. I know you cared about me but when push came to shove, I was always a side chick. I have learned sometime getting 75% of what you want is really get zero. I hope you figure out the reasons you are cheating. The next AP (and we both know there will be a next) is going burn your fucking house down when you act your typical self. Fourth: To myself, you may be a cheater but this isn't actually who you are. The two people above showed you everything you want and don't want. There is someone else out there that will love you, really love you. Take the next 2-5 years by yourself. Remember what it was like to make decision on your own. Plot your future on your own. Focus on making it the smoothest transition for your kids. You got this. You are a successful, attractive, fun lady. Embrace that. 2020 is the decade of you, embrace it.",nomorecheating2020,https://old.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/eit6eg/no_more_cheating_in_2020/
adultery,She finally left him (self.adultery),"This has been 8 years in the making. 8 years of our affair going from a way to escape her abusive marriage to us forming a deep and loving relationship. 8 years of her promising she will leave him as soon as her son turns 18 because she was so worried about him ever having custody or visitation, knowing she can’t be there if her soon-to-be-ex decided to take his anger out on their son. And you know what, as painful as it was sitting on the sidelines watching her suffer alone in that house all these years and hoping there was a chance we could be together in the future, it was so worth it in the end. For the first time in almost a decade I think we both get to finally exhale. As soon as her son’s 18th birthday approached, she started getting her things in order. Going behind her husbands back and speaking with lawyers, making sure her own money was secure so that she could get them both out (her son decided he wanted to move in with his girlfriend instead). Couple days after her son moved out, she was gone too. She called me in tears that night after her sister picked her up. I cried with her on the phone and told her how much I loved her, how strong she was. She ended up coming to my house that night just so we can finally feel what it’s like to wake up in eachother’s arms in the morning. She’s filing for divorce, has been wanting to for a long time and now has the freedom to do it. I’m going to support her every step of the way. This is what we’ve been waiting for and now all the plans we made will be possible. It’s not going to be easy because I know he’ll do everything in his power to make this divorce process as difficult as possible for her, but we are hopeful for the future. Now we finally have the rest of our lives to be together and I couldn’t be happier ☺️",kidsdebate,https://old.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/lb39ca/she_finally_left_him/
adultery,Ladies: Maybe Think Twice Before Telling a Man to Clean Up His Post History🎬 Another Take 🎬 (self.adultery),"I’ve noticed lately a lot of women on this sub advising men to clean up their gross and/or revealing profile histories in order to make them more palatable to a potential AP. Can I ask—why? Post histories are one of the most effective methods for us women to protect ourselves from unsavory men. And now that Reddit has locked down their API, it’s nearly impossible for a layperson to find deleted comments and posts, essentially removing an important safety tool for women looking for affairs/hookups/relationships via Reddit. Please stop encouraging men to cover their tracks. Please. PS: To the tech nerds on this sub who know how to access deleted post/comment data but refuse to provide any information on how to do so when asked directly, maybe stop gatekeeping this information and keeping it from women.

adultery,TMI (self.adultery),"Yesterday, I realized my HS-aged daughter might feel a little too comfortable talking to me. A couple days ago, we were driving together and debriefing her day and how her life is going, and the subject of her best friend comes up. This girl (best friend ""T"") is going out with a kid who's been transforming and has identified as male since he was six or so, probably as long as everyone who knows him can remember. They've been going out for as long as I've known T. So my daughter and I were talking about her friend's sense of restlessness, how T wants out of the relationship just to be single for a while, and whether or not she should cheat or dump the boyfriend. Trying to be a good dad, I ask her why T feels the need to stray from her BF. Here was my daughter's answer: ""Honestly dad, she's been going out for two years with a guy who has no penis. She just wants the dick.""",LearnsFromExperience,https://old.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/ayt8lu/tmi/
adultery,Happy 10th Birthday /r/Adultery! 🥳🎉🎂🍾🎆🎉 (self.adultery),"That's right, the subreddit as it is now turns 10 years old on August 20th! 🥳🎉🎂 A Quick History Observant Redditors might notice that the sub says it was founded by a different user on an earlier date, and that is technically correct. When I got here there it was a never-used /r/Adultery sub snagged by some rando (who had stopped using reddit), so I decided to make a Reddit Request for an abandoned subreddit after taking the time to go through all the steps of establishing this account and gaining enough history to make such an administrative ask. It was granted on August 20, 2012, when I took over. Some people who've been in the online scene for...uh...let's just say quite some time...may have noticed my username echoes a blogger from long ago. When I first started looking for how to go about an online affair, there was a blogger named Riffdog. His blog was funny, entertaining, titillating, and helpful. The comment sections were respectful and interesting. By request (and I was one of the louder voices requesting it) he even founded a small forum for readers. It was fascinating, it was a community. Then he got busted, badly. After a goodbye post, the blog was entirely deleted and so was the forum. Some of the refugees founded a small, secret forum (I had a few, non-sexual contacts I'd made, so it was shared with me), but I found that new forum a bit too insular and ruled through a bit too much fear and secrecy. I figured I was done with the online community aspect...but as you can all see, that didn't last. So when I decided to open a similar forum on Reddit, I made my username Son_of_Riffdog, and over the years a few private messages have asked me if I am the original Riffdog. Alas I am not. One post-script to this section: I was not shocked he got busted, his stories were great, but revealed several details that made me think he could be easily found out by a determined person—that's guided how I personally approach the subreddit. The original AM guides I put on the /r/Adultery sidebar were inspired by advice in that blog, but also greatly expanded by own experience by 2012. By that point I'd had a number of affairs and learned my own ins and outs. When I first decided to see what was available on Reddit, I was reading /r/DeadBedrooms and /r/relationships (the closest equivalents at the time) and truly feeling bad for people who had no place to honestly talk about what was tearing at them without being stoned by the masses. I decided to launch this version of /r/Adultery as a place where people could talk about adultery more openly. After all, it's existed since prehistory. Heck, you could argue 3 of the Ten Commandments were written to address it. People have done it, people will do it; people who are good and bad. Why not have a place where we can talk about that? I wrote the warning on the sidebar because I believe people need to go in with eyes wide open. My personal views on issue are very complex, nuanced, and mixed. The first post was on August 22nd, and was the first of the guides on the sidebar...a feature that no one ever sees (thanks to how reddit made new reddit and all the various mobile apps) just like all the stickies that get added to the top of each post (because people still ask about what the acronyms mean 😂). You probably won't be surprised to know I was on Reddit before I decided to do all of this with this alt. I would drop by each day to read about whatever with my main account. I've got experience moderating websites, so this has been a snap. I know how communities change as they get bigger. Early on in /r/Adultery I was terrified of how I would fight off a determined brigade. I tried to keep the profile low. I figured word of mouth would help it. I would cringe every time it was noticed in the wrong part of reddit and the spikes of downvotes and general problems. I hesitate to say trolls, but some visitors from those portals definitely fit that mode. Others were righteously peeved. I get it. I knew I needed one other moderator, so that's where MarriedScoundrel came in. I saw his writing over a period of time, he seemed with it. He's done really well given how hard it is to manage a publicly open subreddit that's gotten quite big. The bigger a subreddit, the harder it is to keep the community as it was. I chafe at dwelling on the Eternal September, and accept that realities change and do the best with the circumstances. But let's step back a number of years: After a while I was not visiting /r/adultery as much. Why? Because I had a stable, happy extramarital relationship. Before that I had over a dozen affairs of various types. Plus things get busy, life moves on. I was careful to keep logging in every 3-4 months. Why? Because that keeps this account ""active"" to prevent a nefarious Reddit Request taking it out from under me if the other mods weren't active. I vividly remember jumping back into the thick of things when the 2015 AM Hack occurred... 😅 There have been other mods, but I've only added one other myself...MarriedScoundrel did good work finding others who would come and go. When I would check back in, I would at least make sure the sub wasn't on fire. It never was, at least not by my definition which has seen some incredible fires on Reddit. I know the subreddit had some hiccups in my absence, I was not always a fan with how users would create their own chat rooms or kik or whatever (I never participated or condoned them). My surprise was how Reddit's own staff added new rules and mechanisms (often directly to us moderators) that have made this subreddit far easier to moderate and self-police. I became much more active again when the pandemic first broke out, both because I had more time at home when I would've been driving, and more out of concern of how everyone in this life was handling the new normal. I have sympathy for folks in the predicament. I can only imagine what it might be like for folks out there: some foolish, some not, but all anxious. That was over 2 years ago. When I returned I saw the subreddit had finally hit that sweet spot in a critical mass where a community was formed and growing. Now I also acknowledge that this subreddit naturally attracts folks who only stay for a bit, learn what they hope to learn, and move on. That's natural for the topic, but there is still a group here that seems to want to help each other and has a sense of good in the very gray and fractured world we all live in. I had no idea /r/Adultery would become the largest forum on adultery on the internet. It's kind of a weird thing to write. I can't put it on a resume. I can't brag about it. But I'm glad people have a place to talk, because there's nuance and complications to all of the parts that lead people to that decision. Happy 10th Birthday, and thank you for being part of this community.",Son_of_Riffdog,https://old.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/wsym33/happy_10th_birthday_radultery/
adultery,I was at my AP's home when her husband arrived home early from work (self.adultery),"It wasn't exactly planned out that way, but we both knew it was a possibility. We see each other once or twice a week, or sometimes once every two weeks. It varies based on whatever is going on in our lives. We've met in parking lots, hotels, and now lately I've been going to her house because it's easier for her with everything she has going on. Her husband is at work from 9 to 7ish every day. I'm a tradesman and whenever I am there I playfully tease her about a couple things around her house I would do differently, professionally. We often laughed about ""fucking the repair man"" but it was only ever a fantasy...until yesterday! Last week we decided to go for it so she told her husband she was going to have some things around the house fixed. He went with it. She officially contracted my services and we planned for Friday, yesterday. I showed up around 10am and got to work. She said she thoroughly enjoyed watching me do my thing. 😊 Her husband is more of a pay-someone-else-to-do-it type of guy, so this was a treat for her. 💪💪 I took a lunch mid-way through the day, and by lunch, well...you know what I mean. After that I got back to working and near the end of the day, within an hour of me wrapping up, the Mr came home. She announced to me that he was home and played it real cool when he came inside. I was surprised at how well she handled it. Later on she said it was strange pretending that she didn't know me. 😄 It was a tad on the incredulous side for me, but I didn't mind either. I mean, meeting the AP's SO. How strange... I shook his hand, introduced myself, and kept about my business. I made light conversation with him and couldn't help but to pay attention to how he and my AP (...his wife? Naaaahhhhhh!) interacted with each other. It was such a treat to be ""a fly on the wall."" After I was finished and gave them the rundown of everything I did, I shook their hands and headed out. It was perfect. Went off without a hitch. From what I hear, after I left, her husband said he really liked me and that he wants to have me back to do more work around the house. 😅 Now that's how you do it. 😉",sendmeaspecialpm,https://old.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/dgwdcz/i_was_at_my_aps_home_when_her_husband_arrived/

adultery,"I left my husband, married my AP🍾🎆🎉 (self.adultery)","I don't post to this account often, but this morning, as I lay in bed oozing with hormones after being fucked for hours, I am reflecting. My life is absolutely amazing. There are times where I look at my current husband and am completely in awe of every single part of him. I'm proud of him, every single thing he does. I adore his kindness, his intelligence, his body, the way he fucks me. I'm so proud to be his wife. I brag about him to anyone who listens. I love being married to him. I love sharing my life with him. And he loves me, really loves me. He is my best friend. I have fun with him, any experience isn't real unless it's with him or I tell him about it. He makes me laugh, and no matter what I do, it feels... Whole. I'll sit and read while he plays games, works on projects. I'll crochet as he watches a show. But those feel like fulfilling experiences, just as much as going out for the night. This is so vastly different than my life 4 years ago. Those days and nights were lonely, spent in different rooms, different beds, with no intimacy. Not just sex, but no connection. I loved him, and I tried so hard but it was done. It took years to finally leave because, to be honest, I still love him and I always will. But I love him the way you love your first love. With a fondness of bittersweet memories. I remember the silent tears as I would lay in bed. Feeling rejected, unnoticed, unappreciated. I remember floating through my days, feeling so lonely no matter who I was with. I stopped connecting with friends and family, as the dead bedroom and marriage filled my mind. Everything became dim. Oh, but now, it's full technicolor. It's turned to 11 and I seek out connections, and make friends easily. I talk to friends I've had for almost 20 years, daily. I have no regret leaving. I have no regret marrying him. The truth is, I wouldn't change anything. Every experience led me to him, and that is where I was always meant to be.

adultery,One of the many reasons I cheat... (self.adultery),"My wonderful wonderful AP pushes so many of my buttons I can't really count, but over the weekend a little story made me appreciate her all the more. I was running errands as a dutiful husband does over the weekend, and I knew there were some things we needed at the grocery store and I was driving by. Our grocery list app looked a little lean, so I called up The Wife to double check if she needed anything. ""I need an avocado,"" she said. I asked what kind. ""I need a big, hard one,"" she said with no irony and without a hint of playfulness, desire, or passion. ""I've got a big hard one for you right here,"" I playfully replied. Big smile on my face. Fun in my voice. ""Ugh, why would you even say that,"" The Wife replies, flatly, adding, ""That's so rude."" I've been with The Wife for more than 25 years. We've been on the once-a-year plan for the last 10. Her reply was absolutely unsurprising, both in tone and content. And yet, it stung. Once in the store, I message my AP. ""Pop Quiz: suppose you want me to get you an avocado from the store. You tell me you need a big, hard one. What do you hope I say in response?"" She replies immediately, ""I've got a big hard one right here for you. Did I pass?"" In every way, Baby Doll. In every way. You make me feel desired as much as I desire you, and you're the fun and silly soul my soul has been starving for. It was just a silly joke, but in it you brought a joy to me I've forgotten I needed.

adultery,Just not my husband’s type (self.adultery),"I snooped. I’m known for snooping. I’m a nosy person. I never judge, but I like to know things. Years ago, I snooped and found a hidden porn addiction after years of rarely being touched and constant rejection. Would beg for sex and never once did he say “ok let’s do it”. Once I confirmed the addiction. I stopped snooping. It felt a sense of relief. Of calm. Now I know what is going on and I didn’t need to search for answers anymore. We’ve been having sex more regularly. However, it is slowly waining again. About 6 weeks there hasn’t been anything . I gained some weight and lost some muscle and I’m a little plumper but curvy during the pandemic. Pretty much exchanged the gym for playing with children. Started baking bread. Here comes 15 lbs. it’s been there for a year. Maybe it’s that. He can’t seem to stand me. Or even look at me without disdain. This is a pattern. He looks at me that way and stops waiting sex when he is looking at porn 2-3 hours a day.m. I know what’s up. Last time this happened (October 2020) I made the definitive decision to find an AP. I found one in less than one week. My sexuality is no longer tied to my husband. My basic need for sex is met by someone else. I had an AP since the beginning of Fall of last year. I haven’t snooped from February 2019 until this morning. This morning I thought about how yesterday I forgot to wear my rings and surprisingly two men approached me. Another one smiled . And both my APs, current and former, showered me with compliments. Yesterday was a good day in the man department. I wondered and snooped. Saw an array of beautiful tall thin blonde white women. It’s always been that. I’m short black with curly hair and a curvy body. I’m beautiful in my own right but I’m just not his type or his standard of beauty. I’ve come to conclusion that having an AP isn’t enough. I think it’s time to divorce and find a guy who is actually attracted to me enough to want to fuck me and have a full life with me.",UnComfortableme1,https://old.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/oxrs0v/just_not_my_husbands_type/
adultery,Ex AP passed away and I just want to disappear (self.adultery),She was more than an AP. She was the love of my life. My soulmate. We were together over 3 years before she decided she couldn’t keep up with this when her husband started to get suspicious. They had kids to think about and she was worried about my family too. I knew she was right. We both loved eachother deeply but were too afraid to end things with our spouses and have it affect our kids. The last time we saw eachother was a year ago. We cried and hugged. We made love for the last time and that was it. She kissed me goodbye and told me she loved me. Then I went home to my wife and pretended like my heart wasn’t just ripped out. Then last week I saw it all over Facebook. She passed away. I was sitting in my office at work. I had to tell my boss I was going on my lunch break early then went straight to my car and just fell completely apart. I felt so sick to my stomach. I still do. Haven’t been able to eat a decent meal since I learned about this. We hadn’t seen eachother in a year and I knew we were probably never gonna see eachother again. But she was the love of my life. And now I feel like my broken heart is permanent. The worst part is I can’t even openly grieve. Nobody ever knew. I have to pretend like everything is okay in front of my wife and our kids while I’m losing it inside. I can’t even sleep and anytime I get to have to myself I let myself cry my heart out. This pain is too much. I just want the world to swallow me up so I can stop feeling this deep ache in my chest because all it does is make me feel like I can’t breathe.,GoPhillips,https://old.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/jzr6jt/ex_ap_passed_away_and_i_just_want_to_disappear/
adultery,You’re a wife? Soccer mom? Never could you ever.. (self.adultery),"Hi there— new account because my other one has a few ex APs on it. Long post warning. I am a long time lurker but haven’t posted before. I have been in and out of affairs for a little over a year— so I am by no means an expert here. However, as a lurker I know that there are some women who follow these posts and think “ I could never!” “What would happen if xyz!” . I know. I’ve been there. After many failed attempts to rekindle my dead bedroom of a marriage.. I found the dark side of Reddit. First, I was just chatting with guys.. which of course lead to sexts and pictures. I felt wanted again. I felt sexy. I was under a fake name. Not married. No kids. It was a fun game until it wasn’t enough. I craved a man’s touch. Craved sex. Although I was very inexperienced for my age, I knew I was missing out on the better sex years (I am in my early thirties). I checked out a few r4r posts. Found someone to chat with. Was still under a fake name, single. No kids. Etc. As things do, it progressed to our first meeting. It was at his house (single guy a few years younger). I was nervous about my body, my outfit, my husband finding out, how lame and vanilla I was comparatively..But I proceeded. After some awkward chat (I make every first meeting awkward somehow), we head to the bedroom. I just gave into it. He was very strong much bigger muscles than my husband. He was truly focused on my pleasure. And this was totally new for me. After a couple orgasms and hours later, I remember feeling zero guilt. That was it. I was hooked. For once someone cared that I enjoyed sex. It lasted longer than 5 minutes (surprise!). I felt desired and incredibly sexy. We talked a lot about things I liked and didn’t and how he wanted to explore every inch of me. He had an incredible desire to learn me and craved my taste. For those wondering, I did eventually tell him about my home life which he accepted without any complaints. This AP lasted for about 3 months until it just phased out because of schedules. Since then, I have had a mix of different affairs. I learned what I was looking for. What I needed outside of sex. Each AP has taught me something different. I have read a lot about single versus married APs on here. I will say that having a single guy at your beck and call (especially as a mom with a crazy schedule) has actually worked out better for me. However, most single guys do want to leave emotion out of the equation to some degree. Especially ones that still plan to marry and have kids later. (My age group hasn’t given up all hope). I have had wonderful connections with married men though as well. So it is definitely based on the person and what you are seeking from an AP. I have gone through a lot of emotions. Do I love this AP? Will I get a divorce and run away with him? Is it really ok to try anal?? (Ha sorry had to add that one in here). Ultimately, I have learned so much about myself. I look in the mirror and feel better. I was slowly dying inside and saw no way out. Now, I feel desired. I feel connection and it’s because I “did the unforgivable”. A few fast facts/ questions you are probably asking yourself: -Do I feel guilt anymore? No. -Am I bad mom? No. I am better because I’m happy again. -Do I want to divorce? Yes and no. Depends on the day. -Does anyone know? One trusted, loyal friend -Did I enjoy anal? ;) yes, surprisingly. Thanks for reading, all. I hope this helps some mama out there lurking in her pjs watching Netflix while her husband ignores her.",PerfectlyWrong4Me,https://old.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/b9l89d/youre_a_wife_soccer_mom_never_could_you_ever/
adultery,CAUGHT! -- In The Car -- By Police (self.adultery),"It was after dark. We had a few drinks. Due to crazy schedules, holidays, and young kids it had been a while since we were able to have sex. Started getting carried away so we pulled over in a deserted parking lot. Jumped in the back seat. Didn't have much time--due home. It had been a while so we were pulling each other's clothes off. Then bright headlights! It's a cop. He gave us a minute to get dressed and asked for our IDs. She's crying, we're both freaking while he's running our IDs. When he comes back we're trying to explain the situation.... he tells us he's letting us go but find a better place to carry on. Then he told us, ""I've caught a lot of married people fooling around together..... just never married to each other"". Thankfully, it was my wife I was with that night.",Sport35054,https://old.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/9udcuy/caught_in_the_car_by_police/
adultery,It is not abusive/controlling for your SO to be suspicious of you🎬 Another Take 🎬 (self.adultery),"There was a post in here 6 hours ago that got a lot of support suggesting that because OP's husband was specifically onto her case and asked to share each other's locations - he was abusive and controlling. If your SO cares about you, why would it be problematic that they're not cool with you stepping out? It isn't controlling for your SO to not want you to cheat. Said OP is banging her PSYCHIATRIST and not doing a good job of hiding it. How is that not problematic to people on here? How is that not horrible OPSEC? How does that guy even have a license? Yeah he's not Hannibal Lecter, but he's no saint. OP had the nerve to question why her husband wasn't cool with her having these extended sex appointments. The comment section was an echo chamber absolutely shitting on her husband. No, not OP, not the terrible psychiatrist, the innocent spouse. I literally do not understand the mental leaps it took for so many people to call the husband ""abusive"" for not liking what was going down. Seriously guys? Take a page out of the infidelity subs. If you gaslight your spouse while you struggle to hide your AP, it won't end well for you. If you don't want to divorce, keep it on the down low. You can't let your lust get in the way of common sense. We have to collectively realize, there's a reason 99% of the world don't sympathize with us. That won't change - if there's a suspicion take time away from AP to alleviate the suspicion. We'll keep doing what we need to do - but don't give the game away. Phone tracking between spouses when one is cheating is not controlling. It's fairly standard procedure. It's not your husband's fault you smell like sex after an overtime therapy session. That's a YOU problem and I feel sorry for your husband. Find a better AP. Keep your OPSEC at a high guys. P.S. I'm not discounting people in actual controlling or abusive relationships. My heart goes out to you guys/girls and I wish y'all all the best.",,https://old.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/ml14z6/it_is_not_abusivecontrolling_for_your_so_to_be/
adultery,Are you a man looking for an AP? Read this!🎬 Another Take 🎬 (self.adultery),"But before you do… If you’re a guilt king, fuckboy, flake, degenerate, or your wife is pregnant/postpartum/home with young children, close out of this post, delete the “Adultery”, “Affairs”, and “Naughty from Neglect” boards from your favorites, and you know what just delete Reddit entirely. Just go. Everyone else, carry on. This is a treatise so if you can’t read more than a few sentences, you’re not the target audience (I’m looking at you, my AP. I’ll give you the reader’s digest tl:dr version in bed). Another post someone made about putting up an ad gave me the inspiration. Assuming you’re not in one of the above categories and you have the time, privacy, money, and mental wherewithal for an affair, here’s how you’ll improve your chances to connect with actual, real live women. To be clear, I’m not writing this for your benefit. I’m writing this for my sisters who wandered into this hellscape because of a dead bedroom and aren’t having an easy time finding their right match. Many of you dudes have posted here (often in a whining husband intro post or stealth ad) “Hey, I’m a nice guy. Why no luck with the ladies?” Well the odds are very high that you’re a creep. But to the handful of you who aren’t, maybe this will be illuminating. The more quality guys put up ads and respond to ads, the more women who will show up. It’s economics. Ok here we go. Do not come off as desperate. We can smell that rancid odor from a mile away. Even if you are desperate, keep that fact to yourself. I can’t even count the number of ads I’ve seen with “no physical preference” or “what you look like doesn’t matter” or some variation of that. Women read that and think there must be something wrong with you if you’re willing to stick it in any warm hole. If you truly don’t have any specific physical type and you’ve found yourself attracted to different types of women, just stay silent on that issue entirely. Focus on what you do want in an AP: geographically, emotionally, how communicative, etc. If you do have a physical preference (petite, BBW, a certain age range, redhead), fantastic! That’s a good detail to share. It’ll keep a woman from wasting both your time and hers if she’s not what you want. Knowing what you’re looking for will make you a more desirable AP. Don’t shoot your shot. Do not shoot your shot. Did you catch that? Don’t shoot your shot. If her ad says “Local” and you’re in a different time zone, you’re not local. Being a business traveler doesn’t count. It’s not ok to see an ad from a woman in New Jersey, and respond from your home in Alabama but say you’re in New York because one time when you were 7 you took a family vacation there and saw the Statue of Liberty. I don’t care if you knew the minute you read her post that she was your soul mate. Let this one go. Also, if her ad says she’s looking for a man between the ages of 40 and 50, my friend, she doesn’t want your 27 year old ass. I promise you. “I am not what you’re looking for but I had to shoot my shot” was in more DMs than I can count. You’re wasting your time and hers. Keep your shot to yourself. Leave it unshot. Don’t lie. I can’t believe I have to say this, but it needs to be said. If you’re 5’6”, you’re not 5’10”. And you know what? Good for you, short king. There’s a 5’0” woman out there over whom you tower and who would love to take a ride. Maybe there’s a 6’1” woman and you’re her fetish. Are you 62 years old? You’re not 46 so don’t say you’re 46. Or 47. You’re not even 56. You’re 62. If you want to lie to yourself or to me and say you’re lying about your age for OPSEC (cue eye roll), age yourself up one year. But don’t lie. It’ll suck when you meet her, she finds you attractive, and she would have been interested but your lie turns her off. I speak from experience. It comes across as vanity and insecurity. There are a few notable exceptions. This “don’t lie” rule doesn’t apply to your neighborhood. It’s ok to say you’re in Mar Vista when you’re actually in Brentwood. There’s a justifiable Opsec reason to do that. It’s also ok to fudge your profession. If you’re a respiratory therapist, it’s fine to be vague and say you work in healthcare. For those kinds of identifiable things, it’s ok to not be completely open with up front. But once you get to know someone and build trust, come clean or be more specific. Read her ad (or her reply to your ad) carefully. Now read it again. Maybe read it a third time. Did she ask you a question? Was there a prompt? Don’t act like an eager puppy and word vomit a response. Similarly, read your own ad a few times and clean up typos and shit. Maybe eyeball your replies too. It’ll take a few extra seconds but she’ll be more likely to want to continue the conversation if you sound like you still have functioning brain cells and your message back to her isn’t “Hay ladie so good to here from you their!” A dick pic is fine if it’s solicited. It’s fine if it’s discussed beforehand. It’s fine if she’s seen your dick in person. It’s not fine out of the blue. I’m sure Mr. Happy is delightful. But keep him in your pants FFS, unless and until he’s invited out. Sometimes, she’s not going to be interested. Maybe you’re a podiatrist, and her husband is also a podiatrist so it’s an OPSEC issue. Maybe she doesn’t like facial hair and you have a lot of it. Whatever the reason, she doesn’t owe you an explanation. You’re just talking so it’s not ghosting if she bails. Similarly, if the vibes aren’t there or if you see red flags, for the love of all that is holy do not push through. Bow out gracefully. Having erectile dysfunction is not a character flaw. It’s not a personal failing. It’s not a mark on your soul. But for the majority of people who enter into affairs, sex is something they’re missing at home and very important to the relationship. So please, see a professional. Get it addressed. It’s one of the most easily treated medical conditions out there. Take care of it before you embark on this and once you and your AP have established trust (and before you’re naked), be open about it. The number of women with whom I’ve spoken who have told me that they got to the hotel room and his dick didn’t get hard is staggering. Again, it’s not a reflection of you as a person, unless you don’t address it and disclose it. Communicate clearly and as frequently as you are able. Don’t play games. Don’t time your responses. Show lots of effort to talk. If there are times you know you won’t be able to talk (as in: you’re in the OR performing surgery between 8 am and noon, or you bathe your kids and put them to bed between 7 and 9 pm every night), be up front about the times you’re never available. Coming off as eager is not the same as coming off as desperate; eager is a good thing. I sent my AP a response to his ad. He had somewhere he needed to be shortly after he received my message so he replied, “Thanks so much for this note. It’s nice to meet you. I also have an interest in alpaca farming and Dungeons & Dragons! I really want to continue this conversation but I have to rush out of the house for a DMV appointment. I’d like to get to know you.” That alone made me like him, because it showed how well he communicated. If he’d waited a couple of days, I would have thought, “This guy doesn’t have time for this” or “This guy is talking to 19 different women right now” or “This guy doesn’t seem like he’s that into it” and I probably would have moved on. I’m going to do something idiotic and say that if you want someone to look over your ad, whether you’re a man or a woman, feel free to send me the link. No dick pics please. Labias are fine though.

adultery,For all of us up in our feels (self.adultery),"Edit: Thanks for the silver, kind stranger!! I would also like to add I know not everyone’s situation is amenable to this little bit of self-reflection. Take some comfort from it if it does fit. If it doesn’t, I hope comfort is already in your life ☺️ I sometimes feel like those of us that are in love with our APs need a bit of a reality check. I’ve seen multiple posts lately of people checking social media, seeing photos, etc., and feeling like they’ve been lied to. I’ve just got a couple of thoughts: I was with my AP in our hotel room, we had just finished having incredible, intense sex. The kind where you lean your forehead against one another’s and just breathe in the love you have for each other. Then, the jarring noise of a phone ringing. It’s his. It’s his wife. In that moment, we have two options. He answers, or he doesn’t, and has to say later why he didn’t. Our OpSec is he always answers. At the end of a very mundane conversation, he says, “I love you, too, babe.” At this point I have two options. I can feel lied to or I can remember a few things. I intimately know the problems in their marriage. We share everything about our lives. I KNOW that man adores me. But he also loves his wife. She is the mother of his children. They’ve been together for years. They have a history and a tapestry of living he and I will never have. And I understand that. What I’m saying is your AP can love you AND he can love his wife (or change genders if you’re a dude). One love does not have to be exclusive of another. And it doesn’t have to threaten your relationship with your AP. Whenever that instinct to feel hurt kicks in...take a deep breath and think of ACTIONS. Your AP is more than likely trying to keep things copasetic at home so things stay copacetic with y’all. So, love your man. Odds are, he loves you just as much as he says he does. Give yourself and your relationship some grace.

adultery,Buying Cyanide .. (self.adultery),"A nice, calm and respectable lady went into the pharmacy, walked up to the pharmacist, looked straight into his eyes, and said, ""I would like to buy some cyanide."" The pharmacist asked: ""Why in the world do you need cyanide?"" The lady replied: ""I need it to poison my husband."" The pharmacist's eyes got big and he explained, ""Lord have mercy! I can't give you cyanide to kill your husband, that's against the law? I'll lose my licence! They'll throw both of us in jail! All kinds of bad things will happen. Absolutely not! You cannot have any cyanide!"" The lady reached into her purse and pulled out a picture of her husband in bed with the pharmacist's wife.

adultery,Fuck YES (self.adultery),"I got fucked today like an animal in a hotel room. It was glorious. I felt like the most desirable sexy woman on the planet. He pushed me up against the wall after I opened the door. I was kissed delicately and then deeper and more sensually. Still wearing my down jacket and holding my bag, I just dropped everything. He's normally so methodical about putting our clothes away. Not today. I didn't even step fully out of my yoga pants before he lined up his dick and slid into me while I was still bent over. He grabbed my round ass and pulled me backwards. I gasped and groaned. He felt so good. YES, this. This feeling of unrestrained desire is why I cheat. This is what I'll never get at home. This is what I'll recall when I'm old and grey. This is what I need. This is why I can never stop. R/adultery has been all doom and gloom lately. Yes, I've been there too. I get it.

adultery,The validation I actually needed🧠Thoughts🤔 (self.adultery),"I started on this adulterous journey about a year ago. After much consideration, I thought an affair would help me let go of resentment of my husband, make up for the fact that I didn’t get a chance to date much before marriage, and add a little excitement back in my life after years of just being a wife, mom and worker. In the span of a year, I talked with about two dozen men. Most conversations lasted a few days. I spoke with a few men for as long as a month, but we weren’t well matched. And then I found an AP I adored. We met in person and were together the last six months. I recently ended things because he holds back emotionally, showing limited ability to be friends and affectionate toward me. I learned a lot about relationships, men and myself by being in an affair. I have zero regrets. At first, I felt completely addicted to my AP and the validation he provided. It turns out a hot, smart, kind and successful man can find me attractive, funny, smart and interesting. What a revelation! But the biggest gain I made by starting an affair wasn’t this validation from a man. It was actually friendship with two women from this sub. These women understood my marriage, reasons for cheating, and my ups and downs with my AP. We can chat about anything and everything. They helped me gain deeper insight. It turns out the reasons I thought I wanted an affair weren’t the real reasons at all. I was too scared to admit my marriage was unhealthy and unhappy, that I was not being treated well. Cheating was my way to gain back some control in my life and was a small act of rebellion. Because of these friendships, I am now doing what’s healthiest for me - divorcing my husband. I may never have an affair again, but I will hold onto these friendships.",TalkRefined,https://old.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/1g4mxna/the_validation_i_actually_needed/
adultery,My husband is cheating on me and I'm totally fine with that. (self.adultery),"I wanted to use my throwaway account. But fuck that. So Hey cheaters! Stumbled across this dark corner of reddit purely by accident. So i'm not one of you guys (or maybe I am?), I'm actually the wife. yeah i know. I'm not here to give moral sermons on how adultery is immoral and y'all are going to hell. My husband is actually cheating on me. He's 38. I'm 33. 8 years married. His AP is 28, newly married with a newborn. He cheated up you guys. She's gorgeous. Anyway, I really don't know how long they've been going at it. But I discovered the affair in march. I'm not telling you guys how I found out though. I honestly understand why he did that. We really don't have an exciting sex life anymore. It's true, sometimes your MM really does have a dead bedroom. He isn't lying. And yes, I'm to blame. I guess I lost myself in the motherhood role, too focused on our 4 year old. I lost myself in the stressful job that I hate. I neglected his physical needs. I neglected his emotional needs. i know he loves her, but he also can't live without our daughter. Honestly, I don't even feel the resentment anymore. I get it. And this is why - I met my 'the one who got away' childhood friend in july. We re-connected, and have become great friends. 3 months into our friendship, i confided in him about my husband's affair. what he told me next, melted my heart into a puddle. He has loved me since the day he met me (I know, I know eye roll). In all these years, he never got into a serious relationship in the hope he would find me again. that's the day I decided what I wanted. But me being married makes things difficult. My guy has some values of his own, and has agreed to wait for a physical relationship until after the divorce is filed. I don't know why, but that made me love him even more. He has met my daughter many times (in social settings with my SO present, and she ADORES him :)). He told me that he would love her like his own. The turning point, A month ago I found out I was pregnant. I told him and it broke his heart. I had sex with my husband the night of our daughter's birthday. We almost broke up over it, but in the end, he said that he would support me even if I decided to go ahead with the pregnancy. I knew what I had to do. I had an abortion. And I felt nothing. No emotion. No regret. Nothing. My husband was oblivious to everything. My relationship with my guy has gotten stronger. He is waiting patiently. He tells me I deserve better. I know I deserve better. At this point, I'm just waiting for my husband to file for divorce. I don't really want to pull the plug in my marriage and become the bad guy. I'm waiting till the end of this year. Hopefully, by that time, I will gather some hard evidence to prove that he is cheating on me. No, I don't hate him. I don't want to make him look bad, but I also need a proper justification behind my decision to divorce. I care about what other people think of me. So now I wait. I deserve this divorce. Hopefully my husband wants the same.",coderedb,https://old.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/e1neag/my_husband_is_cheating_on_me_and_im_totally_fine/
adultery,Don't fuck men with low or no empathy🧠Thoughts🤔 (self.adultery),"You know the ones... They rarely ask you any questions about yourself, they don't have a natural curiosity about you as a person, there's very little discussion about your opinions or ideas. You may be left feeling like you're carrying the conversation in the early stages. In the middle stages, you will increasingly feel disconnected from them, especially when you reach in their direction for comfort, support or reassurance.

adultery,Does anyone else cheat like I cheat? (self.adultery),"Monogamy is not for me. It sucks that I didn’t realize it until after I was already married with kids. My husband and I are only 31 and 27, respectively, but I feel like we’re a lot older with how much is on our plate. I feel like a 40-year-old trapped in a mid-20’s body. In my “younger” youth, I have never been faithful to anyone that I’ve dated. I’ve hurt a lot of people, and I still regret that. I can’t/won’t stop cheating. I’ve accepted it, and I don’t fight it anymore. I thought I could overcome it after marriage, but nope. The reasons why I cheat are pretty straightforward. I like feeling attractive and validated with new cock. I enjoy the thrill and fresh passion that comes with a new partner. I like talking to people and getting to know them. I like the social and friendship aspects of affairs. I cheat to feel young again. More savagely, I love the look of pure lust that my AP’s give me. I love how they almost go full retard when they’re cumming either inside me or in my mouth. I love telling them about my fantasies involving them. I love complimenting, kissing, and cuddling with the married men that I fuck. I love how their big cocks get rock hard before I even touch them. I love doing things with that their wives will never do, like anal and swallowing their cum. That’s fucking hot. Okay, moving on. I won’t ever leave my marriage. I thought no one would understand my line of thinking until I came here. My husband is selfish and won’t give me what I need in bed. I get fucked senseless by my AP’s, and then I come home and go about my life. I think I’m a sociopath with how little I care or feel guilt about what I do. I can act completely normal without raising suspicion, even after an AP penetrates me anally. So, answer my question. Does anyone else cheat like I do?",HalloweenMILF,https://old.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/dj6eqt/does_anyone_else_cheat_like_i_cheat/
adultery,"PSA for the Ladies: Trust us, you're hotter than you think! (self.adultery)","I often hear (and occasional talk to) women on this sub who worry about their appearance. Look, most of us aren't in our 20's anymore. Age happens. And that's the best part! I'm in my early/mid 40's... To me, women in their 30's and 40's? Hot damn, that is where it's at! You might see the lines around your eyes, I see a woman with some life experience. You worry about sagging boobs or stretch marks, I see a woman who has given her whole self to bring a life into this world. As you get older, you're confident in who you are. And as I get older, older women attract my attention. I was flirting with a 49 year old the other day (I complimented her motorcycle, she complimented my bicycle 😂). That 37 year old mom at the PTA meeting? She could rock my world if we met outside our normal lives! At the beach a few weeks ago, as I pretended to read a book behind my sunglasses, I observed a mom with her daughter. From how she was carrying herself you could see that she felt self conscious being in a swimsuit. She had nothing to worry about. I wished there was a way to tell her how beautiful she looked. I have a long time crush at work. A couple of pregnancies later she still looks stunning. I check her out every time she walks by my office. She doubts her appearance and is always trying to diet--the things I'd tell her if we didn't work together, like: I fantasize about her when I'm ""with"" SO. I can't think of a single day where she didn't brighten my day by just walking in the door and flashing her wicked smile at me. Today we went to lunch and I realized I could never tire of looking into her eyes. So, ladies, here's to you, my friends!

adultery,DB SO is deliberately sabotaging my gym/diet attempts (self.adultery),"Longtime DB. Two years of trying everything people suggest. Finally she told me ""married people don't have sex as much as you think."" Bitched about it to an uncle who told me to ""get myself a girlfriend on the side like everyone else."" Decided to get myself back into shape so on a strict diet plus gym three times a week. SO was initially supportive until I started losing weight and she noticed my shoulder/upper arms had more definition. She keeps going ""who are you trying to impress?"" Now she knows something is up and I don't know if she thinks I don't understand but she's scheduling stuff seemingly intentionally at 4pm so I have to pickup the kids and miss my usual gym time. No problem I'll get up at 4am and go before work. When she 'surprises' me by picking up takeout from my favorite fatty places where I used to gorge myself, guess what, I'm happy with this grilled chicken breast, thanks. It makes me fucking livid she is deliberately trying to throw me off, especially since she pointed to our joint weight gain as a reason for our DB (we both got chubby. I would have happily had sex with her, absolutely no problem on my end, but she said she didn't feel sexy at her current weight, but didn't do anything to fix it. And she loved taking shots at me reminding me that I don't look like I used to either. Ok? We're both fatter, I'll still have sex with you, or would have. Now I've completely given up, she's a roommate as far as I'm concerned.) Guess what honey? When I'm in the gym on the last rep of the last set and I'm almost to the point of muscle failure and every fiber in my body is telling me to give up, what keeps me going is imagining sinking my dick inside another woman. When my stomach is growling and you're eating my favorite pizza while I'm eating plain chicken, I'm thinking about what it's going to be like to go down on another woman.

adultery,What I wish🌬️Ventilation💨 (self.adultery),"I wish my husband wanted to fuck me at least once a week. I wish we didn’t go 12 months at a time without sex. I wish I didn’t get to a point where I became desperate. I wish I had my comfortable life, and my family in tact, and a healthy sex life. I wish I didn’t have to fuck someone that wasn’t my husband because he wouldn’t. I wish I didn’t have to get a divorce. For all the anti-affair people that lurk this sub, how hard is it to fuck your partner? Don’t go longer than a week, two weeks, a month, a year…. Are you deluded? Remember that gorgeous man/woman you fell in love with? Well guess what… people still see them. I wish that sex wasn’t my love language and fucking someone, who kisses me, and pulls my hair, and sniffs my neck, and squeezes my arse, and whispers in my ear “you are beautiful”…. I wish that wasn’t enough to launch myself into limbo land and leave a sexless marriage. Evidently, it is. If you love your partner, fuck them. No excuses, no resentment, no hateful reasons why not… If you love them… fuck them. It’s that simple.",,https://old.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/scdtiy/what_i_wish/

adultery,A few things I've learned. (self.adultery),"As a 50 year old man doing this for 6 years, here's what I've learned. Some of you have probably seen these things before. Always good for a refresher, in my opinion. 1) Anything less than ""Hell yeah I want to see you"" is ""no"". These are all ""no"": We'll see I don't know Hopefully soon Maybe possibly Sure I'm having second thoughts This is really hard for me I just don't want to socialize right now I think I need a break I just have a lot of things going on right now I'm really busy silence being ""left on Read"" on your messaging app, or they're ignoring/not reading your messages setting a meetup and canceling at the last minute setting a meetup and canceling without offering an alternate date 2) if you're being met with silence or anything else that indicates pulling back, one of the following is happening. The other person: --met someone else --is losing interest --just doesn't want to do it anymore --is afraid of getting caught NOTE An AP who wants to see you will make time and make the effort. APs who are interested aren't too busy to send you a note and arrange the meetups. The minute you see or hear any of those things in 1) up there, it's done. Prepare to cut ties, raise the anchor, and move on. 3) Once the other party starts pulling back, it's over. You're done. There's nothing you can do to bring them back. Don't invest any more effort in trying to get them back because it probably isn't going to work and what you do get back won't be what you want. 4) Don't ask them ""what's going on"" or otherwise ask for explanations. You have your answer. Silence, pulling back, ambivalence, ambiguity, indecision: That's your answer. It's ""no"". It's ""I'm done"". It's ""I'm moving on"". If you ask to ""talk it out"", what you'll hear is bullshit. Your AP should be eager to meet up and eager to communicate. Any pullback, any extended silence, is the death knell. 5) If you met on a site, and the other party is still cultivating their profile, they're keeping their options open and are still looking. 6) If you met on a site, push for early meeting. If the other person displays any hesitation or ambivalence, disengage and move on. 7) Define the boundaries and expectations early on. What do you need, what does the other person need? How often can you meet and where? 8) Respect their boundaries. If you can't do that, this is not the game for you. 9) Check your need for constant communication and reassurance. Adultery might not be for you if this describes you. If that's something you need, then you need to find someone who can give you that, and there aren't many people in this Game who can. By necessity, your AP has a life that you're not part of. Your place in their life is limited and circumscribed. Just as their role in your life is similarly limited and circumscribed and there are parts of your life your AP cannot see or touch or participate in. That's the nature of this beast. 10) Along those same lines, don't get needy or clingy. An AP cannot be your sole emotional support. They are not your boyfriend or girlfriend. They are not your SO. They are not your spouse. They are your AP. And you can't have unlimited access to an AP. You just can't. 11) Things can change on a dime. An affair can come to a very abrupt end. You need to be OK with that. 12) Resolve whatever moral or practical dilemmas you have, and do it on your own. Don't navel gaze with your AP about them. 13) Yes, emotional attachment happens. That's bound to happen when two people are doing some of the most intimate things people can do. That said, keep it in check, and in perspective. 98% of the time your AP will not leave their spouse for you. They're just not going to do it. They don't want to. If they were going to leave, they would have done it long before they met you. Whatever you're getting right now is pretty much the most you will get. 14) When an affair ends: Respect it. You take your past with that person to your grave and you never tell another soul. You leave their life as quietly as you came in. You leave them as if you were never there. Don't ever out or expose an exAP. Don't contact them anymore. You're done. It's over. Accept it. You had a good run, but it's over now. That's the Game. That's how it goes. That's the nature of this beast. Grieve it. This is a loss. It hurts. You gave of yourself to someone who isn't there anymore. Work through it. And you'll have to do this by yourself. Or come here. Don't ever tell a therapist. There are ways around therapist patient confidentiality, and if you ever find yourself in divorce court, prepare for that confession to come out, because it will. Don't ever tell a friend. They'll tell someone what you told them. You keep it to yourself and work through it yourself. You got into this Game; this is a risk you take. We've all been through it. Move on from it. Get out of the Game, or find a new AP when you're ready. Maybe you need to spend some time out of the Game before you get back in. Me? I spent a year out of the racket after my first one ended. It hurt that bad. Just my $ .02.",,https://old.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/b5e787/a_few_things_ive_learned/

I will often read something and think to myself (or sometimes even type out), “Girl, what are you doing? You can do better.” I need to practice what I preach. I don’t need to be married to a man who doesn’t want to call the cable company to make an appointment because he doesn’t know what to say, and I don’t need an AP who is such a prolific online troll on several platforms that he could teach an upper division course at an Ivy League university in trollery.

adultery,10 Things I’ve Learned from Cheating (self.adultery),"1.) Cheating will not fix any primary relationship issues you may have. It can make your problems more tolerable, though. It can also make your problems ten times worse once you realize what you’re missing. If you haven’t physically cheated yet, please take a moment and reconsider. You can’t unfuck someone. 2.) You probably shouldn’t fuck that guy that asks for nudes 5 minutes into messaging. Or that guy that doesn’t want to use a condom. Or that guy that makes you feel like shit 99% of the time. Or that guy that doesn’t respect your limits. Or that guy that has to be drunk to be able to fuck you. Or that guy that only messages you when it’s convenient for him. Do you want me to keep going? Because I can keep going. 3.) Just say no to pic collectors, unsolicited dick-pic-sending horndogs, “Doms”, over-sharers, blatant narcissists, Stage 5 clingers, time wasters, and just overall sketchy people. 4.) Everyone handles guilt in different ways. We’re all humans here, not robots. You will experience guilt at one point or another. Come to terms with why you’re doing this, and the guilt might make this path not worth it in the end. I’m not even acknowledging the sociopaths. Can’t relate. 5.) Men, in general, love mom bods. Women, in general, love dad bods. Work with whatever you got, and someone will love it. That’s what I do. 6.) OPSEC is a skill. You’ll be overly paranoid at first, but then you get into a routine. 7.) Most people fail at compartmentalization. Like OPSEC, it’s a skill. My moods were off the fucking charts in my early months. 8.) Nothing surprises me anymore. I’ve become a lot more open minded, compassionate, understanding, patient and body/sex positive. 9.) The longer you’re at this, the more likely it is that you’ll be rejected or ghosted. It happens to everyone. Yes, it even happens to attractive women. You’re not going to be everyone’s favorite or first choice. The search has made me jaded. It sucks, but it’s still a learning experience. 10.) This is an extremely addicting vice.",,https://old.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/bgkxls/10_things_ive_learned_from_cheating/
adultery,Ladies with kids...You will fine in the dating world if you get divorced (self.adultery),"Hi, Long time lurker but just wanted to share my experience. I was an adulterer in a DB. I was married for a long time and kept delaying my divorce because of all the naysayers. ""Your kids will suffer,"" ""you will suffer"", ""no man will ever want to date you with kids"" etc. And so I plugged along miserably. One day I was at a coffee shop and I looked over to a mature couple holding hands and enjoying a date. I realized right there and then I couldn't stay in my marriage any longer due to fear. We had kids still in the house and I was working part time. So I put on my big girl pants and I started to work towards a full time job. That involved getting some additional certification. I worked on me, mentally, physically and emotionally. It was hard and required sacrifice but I kept tell myself that the goal at the end of the road was my happiness and well being. I finally filed for divorce. My ex SO put up a fight because frankly his life was pretty good with me. It was acrimonious. One of my ex SO favorite lines was ""You think any man in their 40's wants a lady in her 40's with kids"". And the reason I write this is because I see this line of thinking ALL over this board. It's never directed at men...just women. Apparently we are all damaged goods as a divorced single mom with kids. And you know what...Those people are full of SHIT! I'm not pushing anyone to get divorced. I know the temporary comfort of finding an AP. But let's be honest, do you think the AP pool of men is somehow better than the non AP of men. Do you think divorced men somehow have it easier than women in the dating pool? It's really simple. Losers and people with baggage are going to struggle, everyone fares more or less the same in the dating pool. I never got caught. I also didn't leave for an AP. I had some really nice AP's and I'm thankful for every single one of them but they were not the answer to my problems. I wanted a clean slate. Dating had it's up and down. I was honest about the reasons of my divorce and also came clean on most dates about my lack of fidelity. This allowed me to weed out the people who saw things in a black/white world. And it allowed me to weed out two types of men on the opposite side of the spectrum's but with the same problem. Men who cheated and still hadn't worked out their issues. These were usually cake eating men who got caught red handed and shown the door. These men were slowly realizing that their door wasn't flooded with 20 year's old looking for sex with a middle aged man. They were usually the type who were ""settling"" to take you on a date and they 100% were the type to keep cheating. On the other end, men who got cheated on and still hadn't worked out their issues. They usually were the ones that showed their SO the door. These men were bitter in some of the same ways as the cheaters. Surely women would recognize that they, moral saints, were a catch for any woman. And both lacked the fundamental understanding that marriages don't die alone. They die in small cuts caused by both parties and if you walk away from your marriage thinking the problem is the other person, you are bound to repeat your mistakes. I own 50% of the problems in my former marriage. Plenty of people divorce and plenty of people with kids divorce. There are plenty of well adjusted people to meet and date. I eventually found a great partner (also divorced with kids). We moved slowly but we absolutely love each other and respect each other. Our kids are happy and well adjusted. My career has taken off and it's super satisfying at this age. As a cheater, understand that trolls aren't just satisfied with your divorce, even though they keep yelling at you to ""JUST LEAVE"". What they really want is for you to suffer FOREVER. Shit, they would branded you for life if they could. Which is why they often lay out some doomsday scenario for you if you suggest leaving. It's just doesn't work that way. My ex SO struggled in dating for quite sometime because he hadn't addressed his issues. Once he finally did, he found someone to be happy with and I'm thrilled for him. Divorce is painful but it's also the necessary surgery to root out the rotten in your life. Divorce is often a new beginning. I won't got back to cheating because I will NEVER let myself be in the circumstances that allowed for that to even be a possibility. To all my cheaters, I hope you all eventually find peace and happiness.",itsokaytobedivorced,https://old.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/eron4r/ladies_with_kidsyou_will_fine_in_the_dating_world/

adultery,Here is what the fairytales won’t tell you (self.adultery),"As I close a chapter in my life I came across this great essay, that many of us who are broken hearted should read. Sometimes we meet the loves of our lives, but we do not get to keep them. We do not get to marry them, to pass our years alongside them, to hold their hands on their deathbeds after a life lived well and together. We do not always get to hold onto the loves of our lives, because in the real world, love doesn’t conquer all. It doesn’t resolve irreparable differences. Sometimes the biggest, most loving move you can possibly make is to let each other go. But here’s another thing they won’t tell you about finding the love of your life: not ending up with them doesn’t disqualify their significance. Some people can love you more in a year than others could love you in fifty. Some people can teach you more within a single day than others could teach you over the entire course of a lifetime. Some people come into our lives only for a particular period of time, but make an impact that no one else can ever quite match or replace. And who are we to call those people anything but the loves of our lives? Who are we to downplay their significance, to rewrite their memories, to alter the ways in which they changed us for the better, simply because our paths diverged? Maybe we just ought to be grateful that we got to meet these people at all. That we got to love them. That we got to learn from them. That we got to have our lives expand and flourish as a result of having known them. Meeting and letting go of the love of your life doesn’t have to be your life's single greatest tragedy. If you let it, it can be your greatest blessing. After all, some people never get to meet them at all.",PhantasmaJustice,https://old.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/qhcu9j/here_is_what_the_fairytales_wont_tell_you/

adultery,"Well, I went to the cellar looking for my balls and I found them.😩Donezo🥩 (self.adultery)","I’m having a hell of a week. I won’t share the full tale, but I have essentially told W that I believe our marriage to be unsalvageable and that it is time for us to prepare ourselves for the end. We have been living lives so separate that having an affair was barely a challenge. Our bedroom has been completely dead for almost 10 years. Prior to that things had been on life support for about 10 years. We don’t kiss. We don’t touch each other. We don’t talk. We have worked well as a team and we have both supported each other in life. But this is not a marriage. Our children are grown now. The youngest is in college. The distance between W and I has infected the whole family. We were once a tight knit unit. Now we are a group of people who love each other from afar. So I did what I had dreaded and feared to do. I stepped in front of W and I confronted the pain in her eyes. I let her see the pain in mine. I shared that I had not only lost the spark but my desire to reignite it. I told her that I wanted to give myself and her the chance to find someone with whom to share these last chapters of our lives. She was surprised but not entirely shocked. She knows as well as I do that while our marriage has featured some beautiful aspects many couples aspire to, it also has had a toxic and painful thread running through it. We hung in there for the kids. Both of us knew that when that joint mission took up less of our time, we might look around and find there was nothing left. I called it. Time to unplug the life support. Time of death, Feb 4, 2023. Fuck it hurts. Over 22 years. It hurts to come to terms with the failure. It hurts to dredge up the story of pain and loss that lead us here. It hurts to admit that both she and I could have done more. Could have tried harder. But now I hope that we can do this the way we have done many things in our time together: as a team, the best way we can, with good intentions and for the best possible outcome for our children. I’m sharing this with you because I know that some of you may be going through this. Or some of you may be thinking about it. I wish I could tell you that I feel I have wings right now. That I feel a weight off my shoulders. Maybe I will feel that in a few days. But right now what I feel is exhausted from all the painful conversations, and I feel a sense of grief for the death of a dream and the death of a marriage. This is hard. ETA: I didn’t expect such an outpouring of support and in my current state, I want you all to know that it has really meant a lot. Thank you all for your kind words. For those who are worried, don’t fear. I may be a corny and sentimental guy but I am tough as nails and I have people who love me.

Don’t be like me. Make my life be a lesson or example of the worst case scenario devastation that could be your outcome, although I think what happened to me is hopefully really rare, cause boy is my heart shattered and boy do I feel perpetually fucked. I was in a 2 year relationship with my affair partner and loved him in ways I’d never loved anyone before. I didn’t leave my long term relationship of 11 years to be with him. I should have. In hindsight I would turn back time and make that easy decision, but that’s knowing what I know now and seeing love and loss as I see it now. I lost my affair partner to suicide. Grieving the loss of someone I loved so dearly is excruciating. Now put that on top of grieving a secret relationship, grieving a love that no one knew about or acknowledged, grieving for your best friend, the person you loved most, and having to maintain a reputation and life outside of that loss. Choose love, live authentically, face judgement, be who you want to be, and love the people your heart is called to. You don’t want to end up like me, you don’t want to end up frozen in time, you don’t want to hold back grief to maintain a life you hate, losing the person that brought you joy.

adultery,My AP got divorced. I got divorced. We're gonna do it!🙌✨Good Vibes✨🙌 (self.adultery),"I've been with my AP for 2.5 years. I don't even know if I can call this infidelity because I had already told my wife that I wanted a divorce even before I ever met my AP. But she refused to grant me a divorce and I eventually found someone who treated me much better than she ever did. I got caught though and she made my life a living hell. My wife thought she could threaten me and embarrass me to keep me from divorcing her. She thought that by snooping through my phone and printing out my text messages and using those communications to blackmail me that I would give in and go back to her. Fuck that. She thought that by telling my AP's husband about us that this would end the relationship. That didn't work either because my AP was unhappily married too and also wanted a divorce. She thought that serving me divorce papers would scare me into going back to her. But she did me a favor because I had already told her I wanted out! She thought she could drag out the divorce and make it as painful and as expensive as possible to make me give up, but she could not stop the hands of time. She thought she could turn my friends and colleagues against me, but they don't care because they're too busy living their own lives. And if they believed her bullshit, I cut them out of my life. To my former wife: I'm really not a bad person. But I warned you. I told you how I wanted to be treated. We tried marriage counseling. I told you about love languages and personality types and what I wanted from you to in order to feel secure and satisfied in the relationship. But you wouldn't listen. You continued to take me for granted and verbally abuse me. I gave you a good and comfortable life, but you always wanted more. You made me feel guilty for having my own wants and needs and for asking you to help satisfy these needs. I warned you. And then one day I finally had enough and told you I wanted out. Congratulations on being a vindictive bitch. Your desire to go scorched earth against me and my AP and spy on us and threaten us only succeeded in creating a united front that brought me and my AP even closer together as we joined forces to stop your bullshit. Do you not realize that no amount of spying and threatening can trump another person's free will? Have fun pain shopping and reading the text messages you stole! Maybe you'll get a hint about how I wanted to be treated! Oh, and guess what? My AP got divorced six months ago and has been waiting for me ever since. Today I got the notification from my attorney that my divorce was finalized too. So now my AP is divorced and I'm divorced. And we're gonna fucking get married. And no amount of snooping and blackmailing and gossiping is gonna stop us. Fuck you. I realize that most AP relationships end in failure, disappointment, or slowly fading away. But there is also that chance that both people's goals and desires are sincerely aligned. Actions always speak louder than words. My AP and I are going legit and I can't wait. EDIT: If it matters, my AP and I have been living together for a year now. Our compatibility is great. And as a result of the ex-wife's desire to destroy me, my AP and I were able to see just how far we were willing to go for each other. The ex-wife put my AP and me in a situation that allowed us to confirm multiple times how much we could trust and rely on each other. Will my AP cheat on me? Who knows? I know there's always a risk with this stuff, but I'm not gonna let that stop me from taking a chance. Everyone only has one life to live. So go out there and live it! I'm tired of living in fear of what might go wrong. What might go right is what I'm more interested in. This is not a rebound. My AP did not replace my ex-wife. I was finished with my ex-wife even before I ever met my AP for the first time. My ex-wife just wouldn't accept ""no"" for an answer and tried to shame and threaten me into not leaving her. It didn't work. I'm free!",throwawaywhatever987,https://old.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/ydnrva/my_ap_got_divorced_i_got_divorced_were_gonna_do_it/
adultery,Leaving this sub and I can finally breathe (self.adultery),"This is a happy post! I’m sure I will be downvoted by the haters🙃 About 2 months ago I finally left my husband who I had been with about 8 years. The last and final straw was him threatening to strangle me at 3am while I lay next to our 1 year old. I signed a lease that week and started moving out. I met my AP 6 months ago and of course that’s partially the reason I finally left. He treats me in a way that no other man has ever treated me. He buys me flowers for no reason. Always compliments me even when I’ve just rolled out of bed. Brings me dinner at work. Always greets me with a “good morning beautiful” text in the morning. Hugs me from behind and kisses my neck. Plays with my hair while we watch a movie. Holds my hand all the time because he wants to. Makes sure to see me even if it’s only for a few minutes in between our kids and work and whatever else. It’s all the little things. My soon-to-be-ex-husband... I couldn’t even tell you the last time he called me beautiful or held my hand. Any time I ever tried cuddling up to him he would say he was “too hot” or “too tired.” I tried. I really tried. I tried to flirt with him, make plans for us and our son to do fun things. All he would do is complain or say he was busy and had to go do something else, leaving us alone and me always with the responsibility of our son. Of course there’s tons of other problems that we had, but this post would be waaaay too long to explain it all. I’m not saying I’m perfect. Obviously. I cheated on him and subsequently ended our relationship. I am so much happier now. Living alone. Not having someone constantly bringing me down. I feel like I can finally breathe. And having my AP there is like the cherry on top. I know he probably won’t be here forever, but he showed me what actual love and affection is and how I would like to be treated. Instead of constantly being put down, never touched, treated like I was disgusting... if anything happens with my AP in the future I will at least be glad that he showed me what I need in a relationship.",not-another-day,https://old.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/ierr2r/leaving_this_sub_and_i_can_finally_breathe/

It failed when I forgot what my value was. I wasn’t angry when I asked him why he didn’t even get me a card for our anniversary, he claimed it was a waste of time and money. I wasn’t angry when he told me he was too tired after work, while I was drowning being the primary parent and taking on the mental load. I was angry when he blamed me.

adultery,Funny story (self.adultery),"My brother lives in the UK and told me the funniest story. A week or so ago the door bell went at 1am, worried who it may be he quickly ran downstairs and opened the door. At the door stood a freezing completely naked guy covered in scratches. He wasn’t intoxicated at all and begged my brother to help him. The area is very upmarket so this was not the norm. My brother who is clearly a trusting guy, invites the fellow in and makes him a cup of tea and gives him some old sweats. As it turns out, he is the lover of the lady who lives next door, they had accidentally fallen asleep after a romping session and her husband arrived home. Without thinking he jumped out of the upstairs window leaving all of his possessions there, car keys, clothes, phone etc. At around 8am my brother was ‘the lookout’ and saw the husband had left, the guy returned and got all of his stuff. He later dropped off a bottle of wine with a note stating that everything was good, they weren’t discovered and he thanked my brother for being a stand up guy. So here is to my brother 🥂 what a good guy. Cheers to you Simon.... if only you knew.",,https://old.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/ag9mpt/funny_story/

It might be your in-law, sibling, lifelong friend, neighbor, pastor, parent. But you know (and love) a cheater. Of course, learning new information about a person can make you like them more, or make you like them less. But, the interesting thing is--they're still the same person.

And right as COVID was hitting, he actually had put a deposit down on an apartment, but the uncertainty that was happening in the world scared him and here we are. He's almost 70. The ramifications of a divorce are different than at 50. I get that. But dammit I'm tired. As ""luck"" would have it, I have a very good male friend who separated from his wife five years ago. We got closer as I helped him through all that, and we had one kiss that promised of something special - but we both appreciate our friendship so much we decided to not explore anything else. He was hoping to reconcile with his wife and so they've never pursued divorce, until now. He started a relationship a year or so ago with someone who knew his situation and wants him divorced, not just separated. So the papers went out last week and I'm sure within a few months it will all be settled. I'm so jealous! I am very close to him and frankly I there is no way that they feel for each other what my partner and I do - so what made him have the balls to take a step and not my partner? I want to say, doesn't he love me enough to? But the truth is he does. He's just so afraid! His daughter has their fourth grandchild on the way and she's in a pretty volatile situation and that affects him too - he wants to provide stability for his grandkids. But mostly, he's a pussy.

adultery,Half a year in!🧠Thoughts🤔 (self.adultery),"Hey all, glad I finally found a safe place to share my lifestyle in a comforting community. Late last year, I decided I wanted more fun and more fulfillment in my sex life after a decreasing drive in my husband in recent years. In January I found myself an AP, and we've been consistent ever since; today marks 6 months. In the morning I'm eating my breakfast while my husband gets ready for work. Come noon, my AP's picked me up and we're cuddled up on his sofa getting lost in each other. Sometimes we even go on dates, taking highways to cities where my husband wouldn't go to. I know we started off as flings and I was just meant to sleep with him every once in a while, but now he's genuinely brought things of value into my life. He gets me out of the house, and out of my shell. It's so refreshing being seen as a woman. An ATTRACTIVE woman. I don't really feel the remorse I initially thought I would. Instead, I feel sharp and bright, in my mind, body, and soul. I catch myself going to the makeup section at Target more often than I used to. I catch myself applying lipstick when my AP is coming. I find myself getting mani-pedis often. I look at my unsuspecting husband, and don't know if him being unaware makes it easier or sadder. Some may say I'm having a ""breakdown,"" but I see it as the most honest thing I've ever done for myself.

adultery,I’m hurting. But it’s my fault.😬🙃😑🙄 (self.adultery),"This post is a mess. I’m a mess. I really want someone to hold me while I cry. Or a couple men to fuck my sorry brains out. I don’t want to think or feel anymore. Against many of your advice, and my own better judgement, i said in my past posts I chose to keep seeing my AP, who just divorced, who claimed he will always love me forever, but that I’m married with kids and he needed to find a partner to fill his empty house and evenings. I said ok. But I wanted to keep seeing him until he got serious about someone else, maybe even during, and still after if it doesn’t work out. That I needed him in my life whatever the situation. Like a pitiful discarded dog who keeps coming back even though it knows it’s been replaced by fresh new puppies. It’s been so hard. We spend a lot of time together during the daytime on weekdays. I’m so happy when we’re together. We enjoy each other so much, our conversations are still so great, and the sex is still amazing. Sometimes he tries to hold me off, but he DOES love me. He lingers, as long as he can. And I know he can’t resist me, at least when I’m in front of him. The bad, selfish side of me thinks, since he’s messing with my heart, can’t I fight for his? If I can seduce him and fuck him and wear him out during the day, maybe there will be less of him left for the other woman. But when we’re not together, it’s torturous as hell. He sometimes cuts off conversations abruptly at 6ish, and becomes unresponsive many nights and weekends. He doesn’t say, but I know what he’s doing. On a painful lonely night I googled the woman he’s been seeing, the college missed connection. They seem perfect together. They came from the same background. They like the same things. They even look like each other. I’m so torn. I want him to be happy. But I also want him so badly. We’ve never had an overnight. I hate goodbyes. My one big dream has always been to snuggle to sleep with him, wake up with him in the morning, have breakfast together. I’ll never get to have this. Now another woman is getting to have this with him. And it’s killing me to know it. I did this. I did this to myself. Fuck me.

Because I now also know how it feels to have an AP lie to you, cheat on you, belittle you, and scream at you if you cry. And yet it all seemed worth it for the highs. And after almost 5 years I have broken under the weight of it all, and he's reacted with a mix of apologies and apathy. And you know something? I'm still in a difficult marriage with an alcoholic husband. Nothing has changed, except perhaps I'm a little wiser. Just be careful out there.

adultery,"How do you know if you're being followed by a PI? (serious)🎵Paranoia, the destroyer🎵 (self.adultery)","I'm a MM with an AP. I work from home so only leave the house to pickup/dropoff the kids, errands, or to see AP. AP told me she thought her SO was suspicious and we decided to go no contact for awhile with the intention to meet up again at some point. Neighbors down the street got foreclosed on and the house is vacant and there's been this white van with blacked out windows parked there for 10 days and occasionally there's an older bald man milling around outside. When I look at him he just glares at me and doesn't seem real friendly. I thought he was with the bank, a handy man or something fixing the place up so they can sell it but he never seems to actually go in and out of the house. I went with my kids to the mall after school and I saw a VERY similar van pull into the parking lot behind me. I stared at it for a long time to see if the old bald man got out but nothing happened and my kids were getting antsy so we went inside. That's when I started thinking this guy maybe was a PI. The van is now less frequently in front of the vacant house but occasionally still there. Haven't seen him anywhere else yet. AP's SO definitely has the funds to hire a PI. Am I crazy or is it possible?",Suspicious_Comb1433,https://old.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/1lgn5jo/how_do_you_know_if_youre_being_followed_by_a_pi/
adultery,Who should I hurt?🙋‍♀️Question🙋‍♂️ (self.adultery),"I’m at a cross roads and I don’t know what to do, any advice would be much appreciated. I wasn’t even looking for an EA, but by sheer chance, what I found can’t be ignored. It’s only been a short time but a connection this easy doesn’t come naturally, and it’s left a lasting impression on me. Our talks are effortless, meaningful, deep, intense, but most importantly I’ve been embraced for who I am; I’m seen. Whatever this is, is strong and it got in deep, so deep it has me questioning my future and my marriage. My mind is a mess, it’s torn and no matter my decision.. someone gets hurt. Logistically it’s a challenge… we live in different countries so one of us would undoubtedly have to relocate. I also have kids which means they will be affected too and coming from a broken home.. that’s weighing heavily on me. Whether I attempt to fix what’s been exposed in my marriage or start a new life it’s a challenging road ahead. Has anyone been here before? What did you do?",Significant-Hour-168,https://old.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/1lgh70t/who_should_i_hurt/
